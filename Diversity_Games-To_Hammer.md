== Character Diversity ==

[[pluralism|Pluralism]] is having a variety of options, including options that match yourself. [[diversity|Diversity]] is experience and interaction with marginalized groups.

There are more ways to represent than skin deep

Hierarchies of identity: Which identities are more likely to lead to action?

Heroes Wanted
  Avatars are a mix and match of presenting feminine and masculine
Dragon Age
  Elderly are presented as just as wise and powerful
Long Live the Queen
  All skills are important, not just feminine ones
Dream Daddy
  Subvert norms
Dragon Age (again)
  You don't realize they are trans until later
Hellblade
  Senua can see things no one else can because of her "delusions"
Thou art But a Warrior
  You play as a Muslim defender, de-center christianity as a norm

Having identity be too subtle means only members of that group will realize. Having it be too obvious (even with the intention of subverting) means some might miss the point

-- potential questions

What is a normative (and non-normative identity)?

Can skin deep representation be harmful instead of helpful?

-- Notes from the meeting with Alexandra

Design work might not count for tenure which is why she wants to go for CAMD so she can get tenure using design work.
