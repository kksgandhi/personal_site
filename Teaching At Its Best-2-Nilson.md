Great resource, worth a reread.

[[learning outcomes]] should have 3 parts:

 - A statement of measurable performance
 - The context of how that performance should occur (and by what medium, oral, written?)
 - Standards to assess the performance

Goes on to have a great summary of outcomes based on [[Revision Of Blooms Taxonomy-Anderson]] 

Exhibit 2.1 is a great breakdown of different kinds of learning outcomes and how to measure them. Includes more esoteric learning outcomes such as affective (emotions) and ethical. Altogether: cognitive, psychomotor, affective, social, and ethical.

Sequence your outcomes, see [[subgoal learning]]
