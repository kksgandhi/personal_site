[[gamified learning]] [[gamification in higher education]] and [[GBL]]

gamification to improve participation and attendance

framework to identify the benefits of simulation games

## Gamification

constraints to implement gamification in higher education... Not really sure what that means...

gamification and [[MOOCs]]

[[gamification]] works! Serious games can be effectively evaluated through knowledge tests, self reporting, and in game performance

gamification useful in business classes

gamification for an animation class

gamification for engineering!

for an undergrad media theory class!

communication faculty used gamification (non digital because it was more accessible). Is gamification just traditional teaching with a rebranding?

gamification for academic content?

gamification in a graduate class on designing questionnaires led to equal outcomes, but the gamified class chose harder assignments

gamified [[SRS]] were great at attendance, reduced disconnect, and improved confidence compared to normal [[SRS]]

[[gamification]] in a taxation course

gamification in a science class increased competition between different cliques (defined by academic achievement), and measures to increase collaboration failed

hey kid have you heard of gamification

high engagement correlated with high gamification scores and academic scores

gamification in a research class helped

## GBL

gamification and GBL through a platform called qizbox

serious games for entrepreneurship 

Moncada and Moncada: games in an accounting class, and also how to build games / gamification into your course if you are not a programmer

I think this survey uses gamified when it actually means game based... Either that or its put a lot of gamification stuff in the GBL category

game based bio classroom did well

GBL in an information literacy course

GBL in a C programming course with Q learning throwing gamification elements at them. Players continued after reaching max points but changed up their strategies.

serious simulation games for business management didn't do so hot

GBL for java and chemistry and german (actually the german one looks neat) and programming logic and python (w/ [[kahoot]]!)

Hamzeh showed that students liked games and learned from them

## Meta stuff

GBL is growing! Mostly in GBL for computing because every game researcher does so much comp sci and that's all they know how to teach lol
