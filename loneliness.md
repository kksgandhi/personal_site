[[socializing]]

Having no friends is much better than having bad friends. Or even on a
more minor note: Filling all your time with scheduled activities means
that you have less time for more organic, but potentially similarly
meaningful activities.\
Being afraid of spending Friday night alone means that you'll find
annoying people to fill that Friday night with. Filling every Friday
with DnD means that you can't have smaller organic hangouts. Sometimes
plans will fall apart and you will be alone. That's fine.
