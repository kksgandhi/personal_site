[[socializing]]

 - Having no friends is much better than having bad friends.
   - Trying to be around people 24/7 will inevitably mean that you hang out with toxic people. Don't do this.
 - If you avoid loneliness by filling all your time with clubs and events, you miss the ability to have organic and potentially more meaningful events.
   - Of course, this means that you may spend some nights alone. That's fine.
