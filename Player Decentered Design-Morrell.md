Talks about player decentered design, an idea that reminds me of [[necessary evil - game]] and [[abusive game design]]

 - there is no beginning, tutorial or instructions, no level one or exposition
 - there is no ending, conclusion, game over, or credits
 - the game will progress without you
 - no singular meanings or explanations
 - there is always something to interact with

This is a fantastic #RTDExample, and probably a good form to structure my own thesis around.
