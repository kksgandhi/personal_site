There are so many input modalities such as triggers, back paddles, analog buttons, and touchscreens. Why have game consoles mostly stuck to thumbsticks and buttons?

What about thumb touchpads? What about tandem controls such as gyro + thumbstick for aim fine tuning.

no one has researched touchpads like the ones in the steam controller, lets do it.

# previous work

tilt controls adhere to Fitt's laws

Natapov:
mouse does best, wiimote has similar throughput (but higher error rate), trackball controller is better than thumbstick...

# discussion

mouse was best, gyro & touchpad were similar, thumbstick was the worst
