- when someone destroyed "who's afraid of red yellow and blue", people congratulated them!
 - there are many storefronts that determine what art should be displayed, e.g. The Epic Game Store
   - and there's the national endowment for the arts?
   - should mapplethorpe, who made homoerotic and queer art be displayed? should he be funded?
   - piss christ lmao
 - skill, meritocracy, effort
 - thought, change, rebellion
 - the simple answer is that even unskilled art takes more skill than you would expect, but that's missing the point...
 - art should benefit culture? That's a coded way of saying art should feed into the mythology of a culture 
 - Those who hate modern art don't actually want to hide it, the Nazis made whole galleries of "degenerate art". They want it to be displayed so they can fuel the hatred, contrast it with what they think is "good art"
 - each era of art parodies the art that came before it
   - picasso?
 - media can uphold the hegemony of the day. that's why gamergate was such a big deal
 - urinal is set aside from other urinals because of the artist's intention and meaning
 - art does have "objective meaning" insofar as you could be wrong about it. Doctor Strange 2 isn't the Titanic
 - maybe you should just... experience art? feel it?
   - but there are still "the right feelings" you can get from art. If it reminds you of something out of left field for reasons somewhat unrelated to the construction of the art...
 - art's just here to make money lmao
 - maybe it's a self portrait?
 - kinkaid

== Why do we value art? ==

 Show photos of Kinkaid, Who's afraid of Red, Yellow, and Blue, and Piss Christ. If you value each of these, why, and why do you think others value art?

== The Nazis hated modern art ==

 - "skilled art" feeds into the narrative of the nation being cultured
 - art feeds into hegemony and the image of a nation
 - The Nazis didn't hide the art

== The value of modern art ==

 - art is thought, change, rebellion
 - art like Picasso and Urinal critique the art world itself
 - kinkaid and movie characters

Bonus questions:

Who gets to curate art? The Epic games store? Museums? The national endowment?
