This is a response I had to someone sending me this video

------

Hot damn there is so much I can say in response to this video. The orientalism and discussion of [[capitalism|anti-capitalistic]] rhetoric as a shroud for [[xenophobia]] was cool, I also liked the connection of [[transness]] and [[ableism]].

They talked about the lack of internal communication which led to all of the trans issues, but I think that issue extends over the entire game, along with probably every [[AAA]] media experience out there: Some writer wants to create an artistic and challenging experience, some author wants to create a funny / interesting experience, and some author wants to create a digestible experience for the mass market and all of those are in direct conflict. At this point I feel like these pieces of media should be seen as [[rainbow capitalism|litmus tests for where the general population stands on certain topics]], but you just can't expect any of them to actually push any issues.

One thing that I've been thinking about lately is the [[something is wrong|inherent friction]] between people's ease at seeing that *something is wrong* but our difficulty at figuring out *what is wrong*. It's easy to say "my life is shit, I'm depressed all the time, and cruel people keep getting away with things", but it's really tough to have the critical thinking skills to think that it might be the cause of a system you've grown up with your whole life, something that has been propagandized into you as *good* (or at the least, *normal*). At the worst cases, this leads to people [[lashing out]] at immigrants, or commies, or whatever buzzword they've been talking about recently (and let's be real, people on the left do this too, but I digress). At it's best (but still just as insidious), it leads to the [[neonliberalism]] that the video talked about, a frustration with the world that doesn't present any alternatives.
