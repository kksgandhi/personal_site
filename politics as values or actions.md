Do you see politics as an expression of your values, or as a set of actions you can take to make the world better? I'm talking about idealists, who fight for their beliefs, pragmaticism be damned, and pragmaticists, who will vote for whatever, as long as they feel like it's going in the right direction.

On the one hand, you have people who [[doing no harm and doing no good|refuse to take meaningful and important actions]], because it's not perfect. On the other hand, you have people who refuse to be idealists and fight for everything they can, instead choosing to compromise in a way that leads to barely any change.
