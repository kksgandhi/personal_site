If a game designer can't exactly define the play experience, does that mean that the learning goal could get lost?

[This GDC talk has some good examples](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1029133/Games-and-Meaning-or-You). One notable one is the game "Sweatshop", which is supposed to emphasize how degrading running a sweatshop can be to its employees. One player commented how they left the game with empathy for sweatshop *owners*, commenting that "dang it's hard to run a sweatshop" (paraphrased)

[[Spent Game To Reduce Prejudice Towards The Poor-Roussos]] similarly shows how SPENT, a game designed to increase empathy for homeless people, actually ended up making people think poverty was personally controllable, and therefore not a problem.
