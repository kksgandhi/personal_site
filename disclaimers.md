 - These notes should not be taken as well researched bastions of information. Quite frankly they should be taken as the incoherent ramblings of a madman.
 - I don't strongly stand by any opinions in here, most of the stuff I've written is kinda off the cuff instead of formally being "a statement of my convictions"
 - If you disagree with my opinions in something I've written, please don't hate me. Instead, contact me. I'm always curious to hear new opinions and learn!
 - Tons of my notes are very short
   - Sometimes I just didn't bother writing much. It probably seems like I have a lot of strongly held, weakly supported opinions, but really I just didn't write down all the nuances of my thoughts.
   - Sometimes I didn't feel comfortable writing my intimate thoughts. I'm willing to share the darker stuff if you message me, it just isn't wise to post it outright.
   - Either way, contact me if you are curious about my extended feelings on a subject

In summary: **This is a place for me to dump my writing, and wasn't really intended to be formal. Take it as is, don't make too many assumptions, and actually talk to me in person because nuance is hard to portray via this informal blog**
