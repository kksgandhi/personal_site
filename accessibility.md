[[curb cuts]] are the ramps off of curbs at crosswalks. While they are invaluable for wheelchair users, they are also useful for bikes, strollers, people carrying heavy things, and honestly anyone at all.

Accessibility helps their target audience, but it's also useful for wide varieties of tertiary users. I personally use a tool to navigate websites faster, and it works by using the same accessibility features used by screen readers for the blind
