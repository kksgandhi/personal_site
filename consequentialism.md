Consequentialism says that an action is required if it produces the best results. The most prominent form of Consequentialism, Utilitarianism, says that you must choose the action that does the most good and the least bad (the [[optimific]] choice).

[[hedonism]] can tell us what good is.

Consequentialism is nice because it is impartial, do the most good, whether no matter someone's gender, class, race, etc.

Consequentialism is also nice because it enables flexibility, no rule is absolute. Not killing sounds like a good rule on paper, but what if you are forced to kill someone in order to save a hundred lives? Utilitarianism offers this flexibility.
