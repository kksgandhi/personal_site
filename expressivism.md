An [[ethics|ethical theory]] that claims that counters [[moral nihilism]] by claiming that moral claims are not attempting to be true, but rather they are expressing feelings about the way the world should work, giving orders and commands, and expressing our commitments.

e.g. "Torture is immoral" isn't supposed to be some grand truth, it's just saying that this is my belief and asking others to do the same.
