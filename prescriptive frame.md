A certain way to approach art, based on tradition and past experiences.

Art isn't just a work (or a physical object), it's a thing combined with a certain way of approaching it.

Examples:

 - A good book isn't appreciated as a work of art if you read random pages from it, you have to read it in order!
 - You can't appreciate a perfume by drinking it!
