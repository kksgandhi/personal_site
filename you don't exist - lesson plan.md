Start with [[turing test bullying]]

This is meant to break down stereotypes about consciousness.\
If there's plenty of time, let people discuss defenses, and if not, let some other people go and then discuss the relevancy of consciousness.

**20 minutes**

Give the [[you don't exist]] spiel and let people discuss it.

**40 Minutes**

Discuss mind uploading, teleporter problem, million dollar torture, and false memories, death of the self perhaps?
