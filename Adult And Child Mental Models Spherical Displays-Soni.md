*mental models* of how users interacted with spherical displays are completely different, users model are more akin to physical objects

so far, these have been designer driven, which leads to overly complex gestures. Designers use abstract mappings, whereas end users models are based on the physical world and prior experience.

[legacy bias](legacy%20bias.md) affects rectangular displays

involved [user defined gestures](user%20defined%20gestures.md)

another study enabled cross-sphere collaboration, including peeking to allow users to see the other side

users are more likely to use whole hand gestures / multi finger gestures

children had trouble with the [think aloud](think%20aloud.md) protocol, so they did a think aloud pilot first where they showed them how to think aloud. 

they avoided legacy bias by asking participants to perform three gestures (two one handed, one two handed) and asked them to explain the gesture creation process. Also asked them to rate their gesture for goodness and ease.

Used [inductive thematic analysis](inductive%20thematic%20analysis.md) to analyze data

similarly to prior interfaces, participants thought of X buttons, or swipe away backspace / undo buttons. They also talked about control panels

dichotomous tasks usually had reversible gestures. Making big and making small are dichotomous, and the gesture was pan out, pan in, which is reversible

users often thought about areas beyond interactability, such as flicking something off into the void

users used above the screen gestures

users thought about physics, such as momentum and friction

thought of object like a physical object

users thought about things in relation to themselves, up down, left, right, etc.

users thought about pushing through the sphere, or generally thought of the sphere as 3D instead of 2D

adults cared about social boundaries (I don't want to send this image to someone else's space). Children did not

adults thought about physics, children thought about objects. Adults thought about prior experience

authors recommend that people push the [affordances](affordances.md) of a spherical display, enable circular reversible gestures, in-air gestures, and to use a physics engine

some users prefer gestures, some prefer finer and more concrete control systems. *Norman* argues that gesture systems ain't that great
