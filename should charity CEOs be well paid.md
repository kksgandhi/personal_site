#todo this is terribly written but I'm tired lol

If someone runs a charity, should they be paid millions? Similar CEOs are, and we want the people who run a big charity to be just as effective as those who run large companies.

Now, I personally don't agree with this. A million extra spent won't necessarily lead you to a better CEO, and even if it does, there are probably better ways to spend that money.

But some people don't like highly paid charity CEOs because it feels wrong â€” shouldn't someone run a charity for things aside from the money?

I like this question because it makes me think about [[pragmaticism]]. If there was a world where a million spent on a CEO actually led to a better charity, should we swallow how bad it feels for utilitarian purposes?
