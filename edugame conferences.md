[A general list of conferences and deadlines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l3YA8ukuFeUdZ2bThN5N50NTasZIieFKS66OLxO6nTo/edit#gid=0)

In the Northeast there is the Connected Learning Summit, which has an anchor in MIT but I think is increasingly planning on being online. These small venues may not be the best as publication targets (with the possible exception of Meaningful Play) but they're nice to find community and they're almost always fun as events.

If your work is more tech / data related you could consider the Journal of Educational Data Mining, International Journal of AI in Education, or Journal Learning Analytics, which are the more ed tech venues I tend to pay attention to. There's also the International Journal of the Learning Sciences for learning but not necessarily tech. Each of those (except for JGBL oddly) have a corresponding conference venue as well.

Some small edugame conferences

 - Meaningful Play ([https://meaningfulplay.msu.edu/](https://meaningfulplay.msu.edu/)), in Michigan
 - Games Learning Society ([http://glsconference.net/](http://glsconference.net/)), in Irvine, CA formerly Madison, WI
 - Play Make Learn ([http://playmakelearn.org/](http://playmakelearn.org/)) in Madison, WI (Mid July)
 - Connected Learning Summit ([https://connectedlearningsummit.org/](https://connectedlearningsummit.org/)) seems yoked to MIT for the foreseeable future (Late October, but maybe shut down?)
 - Teach Play Learn ([https://tpl.iu.edu/](https://tpl.iu.edu/)) at Indiana University, which I had never heard of until someone mentioned it at Meaningful Play this past year (Late July)
 - The short lived Transformational Experience Summit ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVO8XTbRWtuHk6zccLuIA81pBfSAWrIe3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVO8XTbRWtuHk6zccLuIA81pBfSAWrIe3)) at CMUÂ 
 - Games 4 Change ([https://www.gamesforchange.org/](https://www.gamesforchange.org/)) (Late June) and Serious Play ([https://www.seriousplayconf.com/](https://www.seriousplayconf.com/)) are similar, though those both have some different flavors. (Mid August)
