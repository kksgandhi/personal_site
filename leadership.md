Schools teach so many "leadership skills" which ended up boiling down to "speak loudly and confidently" and "here's how to make a powerpoint". I think leadership skills as they are discussed in schools are really just business skills, which are important too, but it's frustrating that real leadership skills aren't as tangible / measurable / teachable as summer camps would have you believe.

If you are at a dinner party, one person is looking bored, another is being annoying, another wants to stay but wants to talk to someone else, and yet another just wants to outright leave, being a leader is about first noticing everyone's emotional state and being able to execute plans that make everyone happy.

This is easy enough to say, but hard to do in practice. That said, it is a skill you can practice intentionally. Next time you are at a dinner party, just try to be more aware of how everyone is feeling and you'll get better at it.
