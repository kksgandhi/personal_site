A *model* to predict how long a new [UI](UI.md) will take to use by experts.

Basically measure how long a user takes to do atomic tasks. 1.1 seconds to click a button. 3 seconds to choose from a dropdown. 2 seconds to read a popup. 

Then build a new UI and figure out the workflow for doing certain things. How many button clicks are there, etc. Then multiply seconds by number of operations to figure out how long the workflow would take.

Obviously there's a lot more complexity to it than this, but this is good for now.
