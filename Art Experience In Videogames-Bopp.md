[[games as art]]

[[empirical aesthetics]]

games leave a profound personal impact on their players

has a brief discussion on the history of whether games can be art.

Honestly #killerPaper for its structure and analysis approach, I need to look up Latent Cluster Analysis for later

Players often considered games art if it changed their perspectives on the games (I thought this game was just another violent shooter, but now I think...) or made them change their perspectives on themselves.

 - players emotionally resonated with games, sometime for a while
 - players thought about the [[implied designer]]
 - players changed how they approached different games, sometimes even changing their beliefs to see the entire genre as artistic
 - some instances of games causing transformations
 - [[emotional challenge]]
