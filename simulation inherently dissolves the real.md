If you dissimulate something (pretend you don't have something you do have), reality is intact.

If you simulate, you are inherently changing reality. If you stay in bed, simulating illness but not actually having one, you are still producing some of the symptoms of being sick â€” namely being bedridden. You can't "fake" rob bank with fake weapons. The teller will still pay the ransom.

Nowadays bank robberies and strikes and whatnot pay attention to how they're perceived.

Heck, how do we deal with psychosomatic disorders, in which the line between something being real and something simulated is blurred?

(Baudrillard says that religions hate icons of their gods, because they're afraid that god doesn't exist and the icons are all that does, but I don't believe that, I think religions hate symbols because they want you to be with god, not a representation of god.)
