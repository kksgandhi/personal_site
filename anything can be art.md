A few famous film critics and film directors have said that video [[games]] are not [[art]].

And that makes me sad, not because I think they're wrong necessarily, but because that type of dismissal means that you implicitly lock yourself away from so much beauty. If you dismiss video games as silly, you'll never stumble upon the beauty of [[Before Your Eyes]], the challenges of [[The Talos Principle]], or the simple wholesomeness of [[A Short Hike]]

We all have a finite amount of [[time]], and [[we can't see everything]], but [[do things|outright limiting yourself to the things you are comfortable with will mean that you'll miss so much.]]
