Sicart's Ethical Game Master List:

 - Create an ethically relevant game world
 - Do not quantize with [[mechanical morality systems]] that [[the temptation of clarity|simplify complex moral decisions]], let them live in a world that reacts to their values
 - Exploit the tension of being an ethical player (make them make tough decisions)
 - [[games can teach philosophy through organic interaction|insert other agents with capacities and possibilities]] (make multiplayer lol)
 - challenge the poietic capabilities of players by expanding or constraining them
