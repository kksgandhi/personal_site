Frustrations with designing games in a research context:

 - Every design decision needs to be justified. How do you even cite many of these design decisions?
 - Reusability of design elements across different groups is a problem
 - Sole developer is a rough spot to be in
 - interdisciplinary work is difficult
 - Using existing games would be nice, but is tough
 - To measure your design goals, you want players playing in a certain way, but that gets in the way of player agency.
