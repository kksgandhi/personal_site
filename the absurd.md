Camus claimed that life is meaningless and absurd. I am a hairless ape slapping some buttons which make lights light up on a screen right now. Attempts to make sense of life are doomed to failure because life is inherently meaningless. 

Camus argues that to have meaning in life you must embrace "the absurd" and flow with the complexity and nonsensicality that life brings.

I really love [[absurd media]]
