if you were looking for things in Copenhagen I recall there is a city pass that comes with free transit and a lot of museums, we never got one though
near the little mermaid there is a park called kastellet that is nice, it’s the thing that looks like a big star on the map
nyhavn is also a very tourist destination bit i’m not sure there is too much to do there
the cisterns are nice, kind of small but fairly unique i think
oh yeah and torvehallerne market, that is in a nice area to eat, and i think near norreport where you can also go to the botanical gardens and some castles and museums - i think there are several associated with a university where you can get a ticket to several at once (edited) 
there’s also a really big park further north i think it’s dyrehavn (the one near klampenborg station) (edited) 
also a lot of nice beaches, hellerup strand and charlottenlund strandpark
the zoo is really big (and near the cisterns)
of the castles i think Christiansborg was maybe my favorite
there are also just lots of nice parks and playgrounds pretty much everywhere
roskilde is also a nice day trip for viking history, the viking ship museum and ragnarock
the copenhagen->malmo->helsingborg->helsingor->copenhage loop is also nice, probably would take 2 days though
if they do stay in malmo the radisson blu has a great breakfast buffet 
also bakken and tivoli amusement parks
tivoli you have to pay to get in and then also pay for the rides, bakken just pay for the rides
