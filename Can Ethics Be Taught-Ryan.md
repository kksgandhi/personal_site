#[[ethics education]]

[[ethics education is subjective]]

most business schools have business ethics classes.

 - classes aren't taken seriously?
 - [[academia - bias is baked in|profs project their ethics views?]]
 - not enough real world examples?

[[ethical education should have concrete goals]]

differing research on whether ethics courses actually lead to better ethical decisions.

[[problem based learning]] better than lectures.
