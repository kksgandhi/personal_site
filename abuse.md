I think that the #media attention towards abuse is super good. More displays of what abuse is and how it affects people can help a lot of people get out of abusive relationships. Realizing that a certain person isn't just showing you tough love but that they are [[gaslighting]] you can be super useful.

That said... I'm realizing that even these [[stereotypes]] of abuse may not go far enough in really telling people what abuse is. I think my biggest concern is that [[everything is a spectrum]] and that for most cases of abuse, the victims don't know they are being abused because their abuse is lower on the spectrum than the most extreme cases.

Still, [[studying extremes]] is good, and extreme media representations of abuse can provide [[frameworks]] necessary to understand their own experiences.
