I think that the #media attention towards abuse is super good. More displays of what abuse is and how it affects people can help a lot of people get out of abusive relationships. Realizing that a certain person isn't just showing you tough love but that they are *gaslighting* you can be super useful.

That said... I'm realizing that even these [stereotypes](stereotypes.md) of abuse may not go far enough in really telling people what abuse is.
