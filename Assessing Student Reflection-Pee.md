Do reflective tools actually increase reflection?

 - Are people using reflective techniques actually reflecting?
 - Do these techniques increase reflection over time?
 - How does this increased reflection affect learning / practice?

Used Boud's concept of reflection, along with observation of nurses, to come up with questions students fill out after they've had a learning experience. Questions like "describe what happened", "describe your feelings when this happened"

 - Used [[Hatton And Smith's reflection framework]] to determine if student responses indicated reflection.
 - Used peer judgement to identify reflection.

----------

good paper with some good ideas on creating reflective prompts, may need to reread it with that specifically in mind.
