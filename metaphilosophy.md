[[philosophy]]

Due to the problem of [[deconstruction]], we fall into a paradox where large swaths and techniques of philosophical thinking lead us into [[nihilism]]

What is the meaning of life? What is knowledge? What ethical framework should we live under? Philosophers have been doing nothing but slinging mud at every theory under the fun; there are so many counter-arguments and nitpicks for every philosophical theory out there that I feel like no theory can be correct.

And what if it doesn't? Like what if nihilism is truly honestly the only philosophy to have. What is the meaning of life? Fucking nothing. What is the ethical thing to do? It's all subjective, do whatever. What is knowledge? Well, [[cartesian demons]] might be deluding you, so you could never know anything with certainty.

Not only is this disheartening, it's basically impossible to live by this logic. You can't walk around saying "I can't actually know anything because of Cartesian Demons, therefore I'm not going to get out of bed because the world might not be real!"

The solution to this is to intentionally be a [[hypocrisy|hypocrite]] and maintain [[cognitive dissonance]] between what you truly believe is correct, and what philosophy you will act by in a practical manner. Here's an example:

I believe that the way you should act is [[deontology|deontologically]], there are some things you should never do, such as you should never murder people. Despite this being the way I think you should act, this is only a practical belief. My true belief is that the "true" answer to ethics is that there is any ethical framework is ad hoc and "ethics" doesn't even exist in an objective sense (not even that no objective morality exists, but that no coherent subjective morality can even exist)

To reiterate: Having a "practical" philosophy that is somewhat divorced from your core principles is important, because if you truly tried to act within your principles at all time, you would quickly fall into nihilism and be unable to act at all.

Random thoughts:

I think that everyone does this sort of metaphilosophy all the time, and it explains why everyone is a bit of a [[hypocrisy|hypocrite]].

The heap doesn't exist, it's only a human construct, just like all of philosophy.
