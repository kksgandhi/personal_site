[[media]]

Art is really weird. Like there are grand cathedrals and well crafted songs and everyone agrees "oh that's beautiful, that's art"... and then there are like... red squares on canvases. 

I've gotten really obsessed with [[modern art]] (a term I'm misusing, really I'm referring to everything that isn't traditional 18th century still lifes) and its sister, [[absurd media]]. Everything from John Cage's [[4:33]] to [[Pollock]]'s paint dripping on canvases.

Ostensibly, modern art was made to challenge the notions of what art even is, and damn has it worked fantastically. I think seeing so much [[absurd media]] and [[modern art]] has opened my mind to the idea that new worldviews can [[do things|come from anywhere]].

I think my new definition of art is really anything that can evoke [[emotions|emotion]] and force you to [[critical thinking|reconsider your core beliefs]]. It's a broad definition, and maybe that weakens it somewhat, but [[anything can be art|inclusivity in art is better than being a gatekeeper.]]

I think people, whether they know it or not, [[art as a value judgement|define art as whatever exemplifies their values]]. This is especially relevant in discussions of AI art, and why people don't consider AI art to be art.
