When something bad happens, it's natural to get angry, and sometimes that prevents the bad thing from happening again, but sometimes its unhelpful. 

When something bad happens, it's natural to assign blame, and sometimes that prevents the bad thing from happening again, but sometimes its unhelpful. 

In my opinion, when something bad happens, my primary goal is that it should never happen again. That's easy to say, but actually holding means doing things that are not easy; holding my tongue, not getting angry. I really want to [[attack the action, not the person|blame people, absolve myself, but I know it wouldn't be productive]].

Focusing on preventing bad things from happening without falling to more basic urges reminds me of having a [[growth mindset]] and [[pragmaticism]].
