Reality, Meaning, and Play

#todo this could probably use a re-read now that I have a better grasp on game design generally.

([[leadership|Leadership skill]]s with games, Yee 2006, check it out)

You always learn within a game, does that translate to the outside

Some games are used seriously though they were not designed that way, we focus on games that were designed with that purpose. This can make transference hard

There is a long tradition of games being referred to as simulations for life, strategy games like "Go" and "Chess" as metaphors for the complexity of life

[[edutainment|Edutainment]] had a reputation for low quality, and the games industry cut ties with it. Now a lot of those are known as "educational software"

Games as objects (theoretical)
Game usage
Game effects
Game technology
Game design
Games as tools

September 12: Shoot terrorists, but killing civilians makes mourning civilians terrorists. Shows how it's kind of impossible to destroy terrorism in this manner

[[system|System]]: Interacting set of elements that forms a whole with a common goal or purpose

Iterate, and between iterations, take into account multiple facets of game design

[[self efficacy]] - power over your world. Gaming gives you that feeling, and has helped people with cancer who feel powerless

Games that help with PTSD by slowly reintroducing traumas

Games have been used for a variety of political purposes
and training purposes as well

Even entertainment games can be transformative by virtue of having decisions and elements that reflect aspects of society

Skills are different than knowledge, because skills lean more towards application

Skills: Cognitive, Perceptual, Motor, Social

Assessment games are in a weird spot because they break the safe space that games typically present. If people are judged based on their success, they play differently

Hoo boy can you collect data with games

Can you test theories in games, or do they not replicate real life well enough?

In addition, games are dynamic and players are creative, so there can be a lot of variables people aren't accounting for

How complex and rigid are the rules?
Action
  Twitch, fast paced, simple to learn
Adventure
  Story, side quest, exploration
Puzzle
  Objective and manipulation
RP
  More action, less story
Simulation
  how is it like to be <thing that exists in the real world>
Strategy
  Management and presentation of many units and resources
Virtual Worlds
  MMORPGs, RP but with more people

In TGD, players are people (with cultures), interpreters of the message you display, and are players (yes ok, but they have different goals and wants)

Page 84 describes a variety of other design books similar to TGD

[[represenation|Representations]] re-engage us with reality from a different, potentially more narrow perspective.

Understand the problem that your clients are facing

Create a model of the game that you reflect in reality
Make this model (and your game) flexible since you may make your model simpler or more complex based on changing requirements

Make it realistic, but in the ways it needs to be. Certain types of realism don't actually add value

How well do games transfer to the real world, perhaps "games make people aggressive" is only true within the game? Or maybe it tracks in the real world, but only for certain types of games

Games are valid if the structure and processes within reflect the real world

Edutainment games can be simple wrappers for education, but that can still work if the learning is well integrated

Games such as the Chiquita game and the McDonalds game can provide empathy for or against a position

Behaviorism: The external behaviors produced are all that matters, and behaviors can be positively / negatively reinforced

[[Cognitivism|Cognitivism]]: Learning can involve internal mental events that are not reflected by behavior

[[humanism|Humanism]]: Learning should be centered around human growth, and believes that humans are inherently good and strive for a better world.

[[constructivism|Constructivism]]: Learning is a process entangled with one's background, culture and motivation. Learning involves taking new information and reconciling it with previous ideas and experience

[[socioculturalism|Socio-Culturalism]]: Collaborative environments should be built where the environment and people themselves aid in learning

[[socioconstructivism|Socio-constructivism]]: Knowledge itself is situated in an environmental context and such environments must include authentic experience for learning to be meaningful

[[constructionism]]: Learning happens when knowledge is applied external to one's self (onto the environment), even with something as simple as writing a paper

Operations are mechanisms in the game or actions players can take. Do your operations create a meaning, or does your meaning create operations (bottom up vs top down)

If you are young, 2+2 is a 2, a plus, and a 2. Experienced adders see 2+2 and immediately recall 4. Experts "see" things because they have similar complicated chunks

Always challenge a bit beyond abilities for maximum learning. Slowly remove supports. Ask players why they made choices (to force them to consider why they did)

Conteeeext is important to problem solving. (Like age)

Super Columbine Massacre RPGs makes people think about the reasons someone would shoot up a school.

Online forums make people think about how different people engage with the game

Motivation, relevance, and transfer

Motivation is required to continue playing a game

Do messages transfer? Internally or Externally?

Multimodality: Games have different media incorporated, and are thus more powerful than any single one

Play has a negative connotation, but adults play too!

Players need clear goals and clear options, otherwise the game might feel frustrating

Gameplay is continuously changing combinations of challenges, actions, executions, and rules.

Interactivity: Two agents speaking, thinking and listening

Uncertainty creates challenge and interest. It's scary irl but games are a safe space

The Goal, The Gameplay, the Game world, and the Game concept

Many players become more interested in games with a theme they are interested in. Ask if your game is meant to be for a broad audience or specific groups

Fun can come from simple interaction with the game world, when the create something of value, and interactions with other people. Fun is not simple, since many frustrating games are not fun, yet are still engaging

Reality tensions can occur when there are differing views on what is important

Meaning tensions can occur when there is disagreement on how goals should be acheived 

Reality - Meaning: Simplifications of reality for ease of learning

Guidance tension: To what level should you give the player freedom / should the game limit their options

Representational tension: To what extent do you represent the real world, and what do you skip to make gameplay interesting

Gameplay can be exciting, but make it meaningful as well

Give time to reflect. Moments were thought is required should be given at times were the player is not time pressured

Uncertainty tension: Lack of knowledge can be interesting, but also frustrating

Exams are hard, scoring is similar
