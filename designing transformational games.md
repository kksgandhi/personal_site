See my broader note on: [[what transformational games can do|what can games do?]]

I absolutely love the [[Transformational_Framework-Culyba|transformational_Framework-Culyba]]

[[Activity Theory Serious Games Analysis-Carvalho]] has some great related work.

A [[transformational games|transformational game]]# needs to [[intrinsic integration|properly enmesh transformational objectives with gameplay]], which is a difficult task.

[[teach via rules and outcomes]]

Most transformational games fail because they simply take an existing template (e.g. Pac Man) and try to make it educational - [[Communicating Values through Mechanics]]

transformational games often have a rhetorical position that they reinforce through gameplay. Instead they should allow the player to discover the "correct" position through their gameplay. - [[Mechanic as the Message]]

Games should model systemic forces by letting their mechanics be abstractions of activities found within the larger system the game models. - [[Mechanic as the Message]]

Steps of creating a transformational game:

 - Empathize (who is your audience, and what do they need?)
 - Define (What are your learning goals?)
 - Ideate (Think & prototype)
 - Create (Build them)
 - Iterate (Playtest and rebuild)
