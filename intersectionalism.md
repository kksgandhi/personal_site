someone may experiences the world differently because of an identity (race, sexuality, gender, class, etc), but they may also experience the world differently because of an intersection between different identities.

The experiences of a gay black man are different than the experiences of a gay man and the experiences of a black man. 

For example, a rich San Francisco native gay man might tell a poor rural gay man to "just come out, if they really love you, they'll accept you", without understanding how their experiences of being gay are different because of class and environmental differences
