If you give someone a process, they won't know where the process can be modified. It's a rigid way to learn.

Instead of telling someone a process, help them understand the subgoals required to accomplish the larger goal. This gives them the ability to tackle each subgoal in a way that works for them while still guiding them towards the larger goal.
