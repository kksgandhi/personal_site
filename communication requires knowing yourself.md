A slightly more subtle idea is that, in order to communicate, *you need to know yourself*. If you don't know why you feel angry, you will fail to communicate reasonably, and might [[lashing out|lash out]] instead. Communication is thought of as an external thing between people, but funnily enough I think that **one of the best ways to improve your communication is reflecting on yourself**.
