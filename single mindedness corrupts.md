Some people gain money, influence, and power through cruel means, and it often led me to wonder why I should bother being kind, since it seems like they were accomplishing their goals without any care for all of that.

But that's just the thing, they were accomplishing their goals, but they weren't really flourishing. People can tell if you are a cruel person, and soon enough you'll find yourself surrounded by people who are similar to yourself, and are just using you in turn. It's a very [[fragility|fragile]] way to live.
