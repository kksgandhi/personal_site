Plots in media typically... make sense, but life is nonsensical and incomprehensible, so why does media need to adhere to the fiction that is [[realism]]. I love media like [[Welcome to Nightvale]], [[blaseball]], and [[17776]] because they have internal consistency, but beyond that, they don't care about sticking to some silly notion of [[realism]]. By being absurd themselves, they allow us to face [[the absurd]].
