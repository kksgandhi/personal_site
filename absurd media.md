[[media|Media]] that breaks from the norm is my jam. Either it deconstructs media itself, forcing you to ask what you enjoy from media and why ([[blaseball]], [[The Crimson Necklace]]), or it deconstructs "real life" and forces you to face [[the absurd]]ity that is real life ([[Welcome to Nightvale]], [[17776]])

Some media tries to adhere to [[realism]] (sitcoms), some media sticks to its own internal consistency ([[Game of Thrones]]), but absurd media eschews realism altogether because the world is [[the absurd|absurd]] anyways.
