A fantastic general resource is [Massachusetts legal help](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing). This is where I learned that landlords can't use your security deposit for cleaning fees and that you are owed the interest on your security deposit / first months rent. The website is a bit ugly, but if you download their pdfs they are pleasant to read.

If you have more specific questions, you can visit the [Mass housing court office hours](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/remotevirtual-court-services#housing-court-virtual-front-counter-). The Housing Court Clerkâ€™s Front Counter can help with filing and paperwork questions, the Housing Specialist Front Counter can help with more specific housing questions, and if you go to the Housing Specialist Front Counter at 10AM or 2PM you might be able to catch a volunteer lawyer who can help with legal questions. (The program is called "Lawyer for a Day")

If you don't want to pursue legal actions, but feel that you want to complain about illegal / unethical tactics, you can file a [complaint with the Attorney General's office](https://www.mass.gov/contact-the-attorney-generals-office)
