A rather well made summary of the spiritual aspects of the witness (didn't talk about achievement or the candle).

Argues that:

The Witness is about pausing and mindfulness. Slowing down, noticing the world around you, and not having the now be punctuated by notifications and distractions is how you find the truth. The theater does display contradictory (if still similar) ideas, where various gurus talk about "the truth". 

* the senses lead to scientific truth
* scientific truth distracts from real truth
* the search for truth is folly
* the search leads to madness.
