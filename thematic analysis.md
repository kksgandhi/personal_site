*The* site for thematic analysis:

https://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/thematic-analysis.html

identify, analyze, and report patterns within the data. Minimally organize and describe your data set in rich detail

talks a bit about differences with other [[qualitative analysis]] and how the researcher is an active participant in turning data into themes

Never say that themes emerge from the data, you were the one who emerged the themes

A theme is a truth across the entire dataset, though it may be applicable to some more than others. e.g. "AR is slower" is true regardless, but some care about it more than others

how many times does something need to show up before it's a theme? It's up to youuuu. Plus if something doesn't show up a lot it can still be important

[[inductive thematic analysis]]

[[theoretical thematic analysis]]

[[semantic analysis]] or [[latent analysis]]?

reach across the data set for repeated patterns of meaning. Read and reread the data

start "coding" the data, writing down the basic features that seem interesting

the same data can be coded with multiple things
create candidate themes and all the extracts of data that have been coded to them

review your themes. discard ones that don't have enough data, combine similar ones, etc

themes are formed of subthemes, human subcultures are fractally nested

remember to actually analyze the data and go beyond what it says

The six phases:

 - Familiarisation with the data 
   - This phase involves reading and re-reading the data, to become immersed and intimately familiar with its content.
 - Coding 
   - This phase involves generating succinct labels (codes!) that identify important features of the data that might be relevant to answering the research question. It involves coding the entire dataset, and after that, collating all the codes and all relevant data extracts, together for later stages of analysis.
 - Generating initial themes 
   - This phase involves examining the codes and collated data to identify significant broader patterns of meaning (potential themes). It then involves collating data relevant to each candidate theme, so that you can work with the data and review the viability of each candidate theme.
 - Reviewing themes 
   - This phase involves checking the candidate themes against the dataset, to determine that they tell a convincing story of the data, and one that answers the research question. In this phase, themes are typically refined, which sometimes involves them being split, combined, or discarded. In our TA approach, themes are defined as pattern of shared meaning underpinned by a central concept or idea.
 - Defining and naming themes 
   - This phase involves developing a detailed analysis of each theme, working out the scope and focus of each theme, determining the ‘story’ of each. It also involves deciding on an informative name for each theme.
 - Writing up 
   - This final phase involves weaving together the analytic narrative and data extracts, and contextualising the analysis in relation to existing literature.

This didn't really add too much, essentially Braun & Clarke had unstated assumptions about their level of qualitative analysis knowledge that they want to go back and fix

![[./docs/thematic analysis FAQ.pdf]]

talks about central organizing concepts but tbh I don't really understand what it's talking about...

has some interesting links to other forms of analysis and coding
