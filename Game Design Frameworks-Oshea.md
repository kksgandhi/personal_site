The background of this paper is really well written, and goes into a lot of fields I wouldn't have expected...

Developers do think advancements in game design are interesting to them. "It is our belief that providing access to information regarding popular frameworks in game design could begin to alleviate some of the disparity between larger and smaller developers."

The authors recommend improving the ability for developers to find information regarding frameworks, while dissemination and accessibility could benefit from openness.

GDDs are a good source, but they're rarely published. Nowadays GDDs are dynamic wikis or Trello boards, meaning that most of the information developers get is from postmortems.

How generalizable are frameworks? How do they apply to games that are a bit outside of the norm (Florence) or games in the future.

Some frameworks are borrowed from psychology, others arose from game design itself.
