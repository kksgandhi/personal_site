[[teach via rules and outcomes|Games as playful systems:]] A game can simulate a real world system, allowing players a safe space to modify things and see what happens.

**Games as learning challenges**: In order to complete the game, players must learn. This can range from "do division to defeat zombies" up to "learn about Aristotle so you can accurately roleplay as him in a [[LARP]]". See [[gameful design]]

**Games as reflective spaces**: Games can provide time, and a mental space to think about certain topics, even if they aren't providing much content. Games can help us imagine a world that doesn't yet exist.

**Games as experience anchors**: The game may not provide that much content, but its memorable, and used as a touchstone when content is later provided, or when a player is trying to recall something.

**Games as social platforms**: Games encourage social interaction, where players may learn social skills or discuss concepts.

[[games as an alibi|Games as alibis]]: Rather than directly bringing up a difficult topic, play a game that touches on those topics as a way to spark conversation.

**Games as introductions**: Games can bring up topics to be followed up on later, all while making players think they are just playing a silly game. See [[embedded design]]

[[gamification|Gamification]]: Using points, badges and leaderboards to motivate users in a non-game setting.

**Games as a pasttime**: Games can provide something for a player to do while they're learning.
