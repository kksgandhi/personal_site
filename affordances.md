Affordances can be physical, aka someone can be stopped by *physical* constraints.

Alternatively they can be perceived, due to *constraints*, but more due to social convention, past interactions. In fact, learned affordances can be just as powerful as physical ones. This is because of long term memory

Affordances always take up some cognitive space

Affordances are relational, not within an object, but instead emergent from an object's interactions with other items

Affordances are affected by *agents*, the *environment*, [perception](perception.md), and potential use
