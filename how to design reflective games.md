How can we design games to encourage reflection? According to [[Reflection Through Representations Of Personal Data-Karyda|this paper]], reflective pieces are best done through personalized design, but [[designing for everyone|if you're making mass media]], you won't know your players nor could you design something personal for them even if you did.

One way is to foster specific [[MDA|aesthetics]] around certain topics. For example, the game [[LAYOFF]] is about, well, layoffs. The mechanics are like bejeweled, except instead of swapping jewels around, you swap employees â€” employees with backstories and names and faces. When you "clear out" some employees, they fall sadly into an unemployment office. These mechanics [[MDA|foster aesthetics]] of dehumanization and optimization, getting players to reflect on the dehumanization and optimization inherent in the corporate world.

Furthermore, [[teach via rules and outcomes]]

Some other tips from [[Reflective Elements In Mass-Market Games-Gandhi|a paper I first-authored on the topic]]:

 - focus on [[media - projection|projection]] and [[intellectual exploration]] as a way to allow players to reflect on their own experiences and philosophies.
 - Think about the conversation your player is having with the [[implied designer]]. The game mechanics, story elements, and aesthetics all contribute to this conversation. Is the implied designer coming off as a mentor guiding the player through their thoughts, or are they being condescending towards the player?

Random other thoughts:

 - Try to create a player profile and encourage reflection based on that profile.
 - Reflect on things that happened within the game. See [[Overwatch]]'s play of the game system.
