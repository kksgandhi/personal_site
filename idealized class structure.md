As a thought experiment, I wonder how I would set up a class if I were forced to.

Note that these ideas absolutely need to be modified based on material, teaching style, class size, etc. I'm thinking about a 200 person computer science lecture when I write.

So first and foremost, I love flipped classrooms. When I listen to a lecture at normal speed, I lose focus, do something else, and listen to basically none of the lecture. When I get to listen at double speed then it engages me enough such that I actually pay attention to it. Furthermore, structured videos make it easier to ensure that the material is covered to completion and without filler, unlike lectures which can easily be filled with tangents or missed material.

The actual class itself would be a workspace for students to collaborate on HW, with a small section for asking questions to the professor. Students who want to work can go to the back, students who have questions can come up to the "lecture area". Assuming there are enough students listening to the professor, questions should be asked via something like sli.do or some live Q&A platform. This ensures that people who are typically shy can still feel comfortable, and it allows people to vote up questions so the best ones can go to the top.
