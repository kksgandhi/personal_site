 - meanings arise out of social interaction
 - meanings are modified by interpretation
 - humans create worlds of experience
 - the meanings of those worlds come from interaction and are shaped by self reflection
 - self interaction is interwoven with social interaction and social influences
 - society is a shifting mosaic

 - general theories are not useful
 - local understanding is important
 - fuck objectivity
 - don't bother importing theories from the natural sciences
 - don't ignore history
 - don't ignore individuals
 - ask "how" questions, not "why" questions
