Often when people talk about ethics, they aren't specifically talking about "they did the right or wrong thing", they are instead talking about "hey am I ok leaving my kids around them?" or "do I want to hang out with them"

Someone who slathers themselves in Jello and rolls around every evening isn't doing anything morally wrong, but I'd feel a bit conflicted leaving my kids with them.
