Zimbardo showed that wearing a hood and hiding your identity makes you crueler.

Hits a lot of the "obvious notes", people are more likely to be toxic over text rather than face to face.

People are less likely to answer sensitive survey questions when a photo of the surveyer was attached.

The study had anonymity (identifying screen name or not), visibility (side view webcam or not), or eye contact (forward webcam or not)

Participants had to argue about whether their loved one deserved a life saving drug or not (wtf???)
