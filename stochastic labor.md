Tags: [[stochastic]]

Work that has to be randomly picked up, done for a little while, and then dropped. For example, if you're organizing an event, you have to deal with a million little things, but it's not something you can sit down and *do*. You have to answer a couple emails, do other things, call some people, do other things, fill out some forms, etc.

I find stochastic labor difficult because of the cost of [[context switching]]
