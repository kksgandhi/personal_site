 - scraped reddit comments and created a survey to determine community feelings on performance enhancing drugs in eSports.
 - Used a quiz on ~20 participants to determine whether their privacy policy game was effective in teaching. They also did an interview, but that section wasn't that long.
 - Semi structured interviews of 27 game developers.
 - Designed wearables and tested w/ WOZ study + thematic analysis for the interviews
 - Iterative design w/ participants to develop anti-toxicity tools. Used some interesting proxies rather than implement their tools in a real game.
 - the methods were beyond me, but they essentially tried to make a gameful version of a validated survey.
 - Made an impressive prototype game to study visual cues in VR. 20 participants, used a visual cues survey, and a qualitative analysis method (that I couldn't understand because it was written in German)
 - Qualitative interviewing of 20ish participants to analyze a board game about gut health.
 - mobile AR game, 91 students in classrooms, interviews and surveying.
 - made two game about attention, one with integrated design, one without, and looked at a variety of scores.
 - Measured reaction timing of 30 participants when using an LED strip to aid in their gaming experience. PXI and a bunch of other questionnaires.
 - Did a pilot community survey, interviewed an expert, and had 13 participants look at a prototype + qualitative data analysis.
 - Used System Usability Scale and their own questionnaire with 16 participants to analyze a new behavior tree visualization tool.
 - Had 25 people take some presence and sickness questionnaires when looking at a VR locomotion technique. (also created custom questions)
 - Content analyzed 2.8K reddit posts about pay to win unfairness.
 - Put a game about civility into 6 11th grade classes, had some qualitative feedback (also measured time played outside class as a metric of general fun). They made some mathematical models that I didn't really understand because I skimmed.
 - Analyzed reddit posts, used machine learning to do pre-processing, followed by thematic analysis.
 - Thematic analysis of 32 codes of conduct
 - Semi structured interviews with 15 pinball players. 
 - Qualitative survey of 91 people about whether they'd want to influence a streamer's environment (lighting, gadgets, etc.). Afterwards, participants acted as streamers and they WOZ'd an audience that controlled their setup.
 - Measured physiology of a variation on beatsaber, N=54, some qualitative.
 - Looked at video recordings of people eating together in Covid to understand how people play in these scenarios. Used interaction analysis (Jordan, Henderson, 1995 interaction analysis journal of learning sciences)
 - Built stuffed animal game controllers and had 15 participants go through TLX / CSI
 - Used functional near infrared spectroscopy to look at cognitive effort in playing video games.
 - Narrative literature review looking at how values affect various parts of the game development life cycle.
 - Created an eSport game database, evaluated usability with 4 esport experts.
 - Development and evaluation of an 11 item version of the player experience inventory.

Meta-Research
-------------

Thoughts
========

 - lots of quant studies with smaller research sizes than I thought.
 - qual studies usually had 20ish people
 - quant studies had surprisingly variable
 - surveys usually had ~100ish people

Methods
-------

 - Wizard of Oz
 - Thematic analysis
 - Grounded theory
 - Validated Survey
