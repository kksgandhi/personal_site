When you are social in life, you deal with:

* Seeing the same people repeatedly
* Scheduling conflicts
* Differing interests
* Annoying or problematic people

DnD games are a microcosm of interaction in everyday life. Putting the same people in a room for 3 hours a week creates interesting challenges that you face in lesser capacities in everyday life. I personally feel like I've learned more about leadership and how to deal with interpersonal conflict through DnD than pretty much any other medium.  From simple things like managing people's schedules, to resolving differences in what people want out of the story, to extreme cases such as the need to remove someone who makes everyone else feel uncomfortable.\ DnD with the wrong people is horrid, but DnD with the right people is one of the most rewarding experiences ever. Some of my greatest stories come from it, and some of my best friends have been made through it.
