The me from 10 years ago is dead. I have a lot of his memories, his beliefs, he helped me be who I am now. That said, no one could ever talk to him again. I could do my best impression of him, but it would probably be just as bad as if I tried to do an impression of a good friend of mine.

People die in this way all the time, and we're all fine with it. If your friend learns something new or changes their mind, we don't mourn the loss of who was, we barely register it. Thinking about it in this way makes saying goodbye a lot easier.
