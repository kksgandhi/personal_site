About [[ethical thinking]], not ethics

points out some fields other than ethics where games can be used for teaching.

RQs

 - Do male players practice ethical thinking in RPGs
 - Are there differences between game and written scenario?
 - Are there differences between individual in game scenarios vs other in game scenarios?
 - How design better game?

---------

Control condition was a written version of the game scenarios.

Played through the game alone, then at the end with a researcher

in vivo coding of the participant interviews

an explanation of how Fable III works...

Scenarios

 - Sacrifice your childhood friend to save villagers
 - Remove the tax on parents but lose out on money
 - Save Walter, which takes a bunch of irl time
 - Chastise an employee who stole a drill (not in original game, but a researcher provided scenario)

Apparently some game participants reached out to real people when wondering what they should do.

 - Suggests the cultivation of relationships, including virtual ones
 - Enable the exchange of ideas and perspectives.
 - Provide meaningful feedback
 - Enable iteration
   - choices should be revisitable, not necessarily completely good or evil, and the player should work towards good or evil instead of it being chosen for them.
