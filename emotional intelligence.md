[[maturity]]

I think one of my biggest triumphs is my emotional intelligence. I allow myself to feel, negatively and positively, but I never allow those emotions to control myself. I can have the worst day in the world, but I'll never lash out at anyone because of that. I'm not perfect, but I try my damndest to be.

This doesn't come easily, and it took years of [[introspection]] before I was in a place where I was happy about myself.
