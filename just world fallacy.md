The mistaken belief that the world is in some abstract way, fair. That the people who have power earned it and the people who are in pain deserved it.

Why aren't we fighting to make the world better? Because it is just, and everyone gets what they deserve in the end.

If someone claims that the world is just, ask them if [[veil of ignorance|they'd have been ok being born impoverished]]. If everyone can make it through hard work, shouldn't they be ok in the hypothetical where they were born in abject poverty?
