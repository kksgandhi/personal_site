The types of knowledge are generally declarative/factual/conceptual/propositional, like "I know the formula for solving a parabola" and procedural/imperative/performative/implicit knowledge, like "I know how to juggle". Depending on your definitions, you can break this down into 2 or more types depending on whether you separate, for example, event recall from conceptual fact memorization. Some people also say conditional knowledge is different -- whereas declarative is the "what" and procedural is the "how", conditional is knowing the "when and why" to applying knowledge.
