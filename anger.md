Is anger valuable?

I feel so oddly on the fence about this because anger is such a poisonous emotion, and so much of the philosophy of [[happiness]] talks about letting go of anger. On the other hand, I can't deny that a lot of good has come out of anger. People have improved their lives because of anger at their circumstances. Corrupt regimes have been overthrown because of anger at their corruption. 

Anger is a powerful motivational tool, though [[stoicism]] can help turn it into a tool instead of letting it control you.
