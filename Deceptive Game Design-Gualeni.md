[[deceptive game design]]

Talks briefly about [[critical play]] and introduces [[designer subversion]].

Deceptive game design leads to "[[ludic unreliability]]", though this unreliability can sometimes be unintentional

covert deception: Where a lie serves an in-game purpose

overt deception: Where the game designer lies, but the player is supposed to find out the lie

[[Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice]]

Waldo.io: Says you're playing with other players, but it's actually singleplayer v AI

Gone Home seems like a horror game, but is actually an intimate reflection on relationships

Undertale your LV and EXP are actually tracking how violent you've been

MGS2 you aren't playing as the protag from MGS1, but a rookie

Necessary Evil you play as the minion, not the protagonist

other examples:

 - frog fractions
 - aim assist
 - spops
 - opera Omnia
