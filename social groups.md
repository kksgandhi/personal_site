Social identity: I feel like I'm part of this group

Self categorization: I feel like you're part of this group

Social cohesion: We act according to shared social norms

Stages of group formation:

 - Forming
   - Group is formed
 - Storming
   - Group conflict as there are different norms of interaction
 - Norming
   - Group negotiates common norms that the group will act by.
 - Performing
   - Group leverages their norms to perform higher dependency tasks.

Existing bonds facilitate group norming.

Small groups need fewer bonds to perform at a higher level

Larger groups naturally have fewer bonds

Primary groups: Groups formed for the people

Secondary groups: Groups formed for the thing.

Groups grow to 5, 15, 50, 150, 500, 1500 based on [[Dunbar's layers]]

groups at 50 and 150 find stability based on sense of purpose. Groups at 500 and 1500 typically need hierarchy and a few leaders who each represent 50-150 other members. These act as bridges to allow medium groups to have weak ties to other groups, allowing rapid sharing of resources, opportunities, and information.

Three types of identity with a group: weak identities, official identities, and stereotype based identities.

Division of Labor: Smaller groups have overlapping roles, then there's specialization, then jobs become identities.

Economies: sharing -> barter -> economic networks

Rules: personal negotiations -> decided rules -> structured / public rules

Communication: interpersonal communication -> tiered communication -> broadcast communication

[[social hierarchy]]

Disagreements: Personal conflict / withdrawal -> cliques and bullies -> demonizing outgroups / law enforcement.
