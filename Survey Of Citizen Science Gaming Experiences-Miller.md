[[citizen science games]] struggle with retention due to: 

 - players wanting more science communication regarding updates on the project
 - players need better instruction
 - UI sucks
 - data focused CSGs suffer from poor task quality
 - bugs and crashes

[[motivation in citizen science]] (prior work)

Mostly focused on foldit

tutorial teaches most of the skills fairly well

players think the puzzles are reasonably challenging but when they're stuck they don't really ask for help. This means some skills could never be taught, which sucks.

CSG games should follow [[games as a service]] - frequent updates about the science and to the game.

Bug fixes, QoL improvements, and new ways to play are requested, but how does this break down across player types?

players want to contribute to the science, though a bunch still talk about the game (oh and don't forget educational value)

quantitative work would be nice, though it's impossible to put telemetry hooks in the same way in all games.
