Kaufman and Flanagan have some things to say about [[psychological reactance]]

Background mentions the Embedded Design Model, might be interesting to look into.

Created two versions of a game, one where NPCs communicate to an avatar you are controlling, and the other where NPCs refer to "you".

Their research question was about "how can game design support reflection in the context of work-life balance". I find this interesting because the actual paper (and its results) were about two versions of a game, so I imagined their research question would be about these two versions...

They took an inductive / deductive approach, first coding the participant responses, then using [[Fleck and Fitzpatrick's reflection framework]] to identify instances of various levels of reflection.

Results summary: They argue that a relevant context is important, but so is a separated player avatar, that way players can have some distance in which to reflect.

Ooh there's evidence of transformational reflection. (Section 5.1.4 and 5.2)

Questions:

1. What they were they trying to achieve in the game and how they were going about making choices.  
2. How they felt about scenarios and outcomes in the game and whether anything surprised them.  
3. Whether they related to the game or identified with any of the characters.
4. How they felt about the game ending and the descriptions they were given.
5. Whether they would choose to play again if given the opportunity.
6. Whether they had any further comments.
