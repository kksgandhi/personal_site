Background mentions the Embedded Design Model, might be interesting to look into.

Created two versions of a game, one where NPCs communicate to an avatar you are controlling, and the other where NPCs refer to "you".

Their research question was about "how can game design support reflection in the context of work-life balance". I find this interesting because the actual paper (and its results) were about two versions of a game, so I imagined their research question would be about these two versions...

Results summary: They argue that a relevant context is important, but so is a separated player avatar, that way players can have some distance in which to reflect.

Ooh there's evidence of transformational reflection.
