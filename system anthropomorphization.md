"Capitalism subsumes all critique unto itself".

Ok but like... capitalism isn't an entity. It's not a being with wants. To what extent can you call it one?

A lot of times, it is helpful to think of things as beings ([[self|and what does it mean to be an individual being, anyways]]), but it's important — and interesting — to think about what makes up this "being". What are the brains of capitalism? What extends its power? [[you can only demolish a building whose structure you understand]]
