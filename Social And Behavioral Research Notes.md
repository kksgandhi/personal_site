Bruh the [[Tuskegee]] study wtf.

Belmont Report
	People should have autonomy
	If people don't have autonomy, they should be protected (children)
	
Voluntary, informed consent

Beneficence - respect their decisions, protect from harm, secure their wellbeing
	
Don't choose something just because it is convenient (like prisoners)

Anonymity can be easily broken by someone intelligent

-------------

IRB only necessary if human subject and is research.

Research: Systematic investigation to create generalizable knowledge

Even if something is about living subjects, if it's just information about them instead of stuff about their specific behaviors, opinions, and characteristics, then it is not subject

private information? Reasonable expecation of privacy lmao.

Don't let people be identifiable
