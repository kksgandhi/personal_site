So Baudrillard claims that Disneyland is a simulation meant to provide credence to the rest of America. Disneyland is obviously fake, that makes the rest of America seem real, even though America is hyperreal in itself.

I'm not sure I agree, seems to have a lot of the same criticisms as [[generalizing statements]].

Was Disneyland set up this way by the American system? Do people look at Disneyland and the rest of the US and think one is real and the other isn't?
