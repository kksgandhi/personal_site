It's insane to me the amount of judgments and assumptions people make without complete information. I'm all for deciding someone is toxic if you have evidence of the fact, but so many people are quick to jump to negative perceptions of people.

If a new friend is late to something, assume they had a good reason. If they tell you it's because they were drunkenly playing Mario Kart and lost track of time... that's when you can assume wrong of them.
