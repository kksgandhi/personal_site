OW is a masterclass in game design. [[games - KISS|Most characters only have a few abilities, but you can do so much with them.]]

Someone called OW's POTG (Play of the Game) system the most creative game mechanic of 2016, and I'm inclined to agree. The system replays what it considers the most pivotal moment of the match. At its best, it does a few things:

 - Allows reflection on the match itself
 - Makes the match stick in your head by defining it by its most pivotal moment
 - Allows you to come back months later and remember the match / remember that era of the game. Sometimes I go back to POTGs and say "Oh that's when I used to play Zarya, that was so much fun."
