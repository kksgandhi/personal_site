Principles of deep games by [[Rusch]]

Lot of struggles. How do you portray being [[othered]] as something that exists, that is somewhat visible but somewhat hideable. [[X-men]] portray being othered as being superior, which also isn't something this game wanted to do.

Explores lots of queer tropes in media: [[villain coding]], [[bury your gays]], and reminds me of the [[representation trilemma]].

Argues that [[queer media]] definitionally has to deal with queer issues, merely including queer characters doesn't elevate something to queer media.

[[Fragile Equilibrium]] uses [[interconnected MDA]], this game intended to as well. The metaphor of floating is meant to embody mood and depression.

Has some interesting thoughts on passing, the game explores it by giving the player the opportunity to pass or not.

Scott [[Rettberg]] has some rules on [[interactive fiction]], maybe come back to it?
