[[little q]] vs [[big q]]

According to [this site](https://gradcoach.com/qualitative-data-analysis-methods/), these are the 6 biggest qualitative methods

 - [[qualitative content analysis]]
 - [[narrative analysis]]
 - [[discourse analysis]]
 - [[thematic analysis]]
   - probably the one I use most often, though I want to learn more about grounded theory
 - [[grounded theory]]
	 - Thematic analysis is more about the researcher developing themes, whereas grounded theory is about creating an explanatory theory for a phenomenon.
 - [[interpretive phenomenological analysis]]

Other methods:

 - Autoethnography
 - Trajectory Analysis
