 - there are multiple perspectives
 - knowledge is constructed
 - medium of communication affects the message
 - intelligence is required for communication???
 - medium of communication affects what we can even say in the message
 - use multiple methods of research
 - research communities choose forms of communication for political reasons just as much as epistemological reasons.

Inquiry is:

 - field focused
 - the researcher matters
 - interpretive 
 - the researcher's voice is present. No passive voice.
 - attend to particulars, not generalizations
 - a transaction of knowledge that is a product of interaction
