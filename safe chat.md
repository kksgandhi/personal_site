We need to create a chat system without profanity so people can leave [cairns](cairns.md) without there being negativity

*wizard 101* uses a few different systems depending on context, some that might be interesting for us would be: pregenerated messages only, or only words from an allowed dictionary

dark souls has a similar system with its [soapstones](soapstones.md)

*toontown online* uses a pregenerated system as well, though they have a lot of messages, and what messages you can choose changes based on context

*club penguin* uses a hierarchical menu system for its very safe chat, this allows people to find systems far quicker

*forums* simply use moderator approval a lot of times

*town of salem* uses a simple replacement filter

Perhaps we could just look at [profanity filters](profanity%20filters.md)?
