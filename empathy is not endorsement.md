I started listening to a [[podcasts]] called "Conversations with people who hate me" which interviews people who write hateful messages, often on other work the show's host has done.

The tagline of the show is "empathy is not endorsement" which I really like.

You can understand what someone has done, why they've done it, even feel for them, without advocating for them or the things they've done.
