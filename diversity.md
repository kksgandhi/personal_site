One of my core beliefs is that [[diversity]] is important. While this applies to [[racial diversity]], I think it also applies to ideas such as [[diversity of thought]], [[diversity of interests]], and [[diversity of your social circle]]

Even the smartest people in the world have cognitive biases and blindspots that you simply cannot overcome without engaging in other perspectives. A shoemaker probably can guess a lot about the life of a shirtmaker, but will never truly know if they are correct until they actually engage with the shirtmaker and understand their experiences.

Wisdom comes from unexpected places, which is why I try my damndest to try as many things out, keep an [[open mindedness|open mind]], avoid [[dismissal]], and [[listening to the other|engage with those who have different beliefs than I do]]
