Ethics (more specifically, [[normative ethics]]) is the study of whether punching someone is good or bad. [[value theory|Value theory]] is the study of what it means to live a good life. [[metaethics|Metaethics]] is the study of what "good" even means.

[[Why study ethics]]?

Extremely broadly speaking, ethics is split into two categories: "There are certain actions you should never take, like murder" ([[deontology]]) vs "Anything is ok as long as it leads to good outcomes" ([[consequentialism]])

Often, [[definitions of ethics|ethics means different things to different people]]

Most of my notes on ethics come from PHIL 306 (the ethics course I took at Rice) and [The Fundamentals of Ethics, by Russ Shafer Landau](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Ethics-Russ-Shafer-Landau/dp/0199997233)
