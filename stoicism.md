Here is a naive understanding of stoicism:

Stoicism is a detachment from happiness and sadness. A true stoic is not sad when a loved one dies, is not happy when they win the lottery. Only by detaching yourself can you be emotionally sound in a world filled with turmoil.

Here is a... better view of stoicism:

Stoicism is a philosophy of [emotional intelligence](emotional%20intelligence.md). A stoic understands why an event makes them feel happy or sad, and understands the value of those emotions, without letting emotions control them. A stoic might be [happy](happiness.md), but their happiness does not derive solely from their surroundings, and will retain their happiness even if they lose their material wealth. Similarly, a stoic might endure some hardship, and feel *sad* as a way to deal it, but won't let their sadness define them, won't lash out in [anger](anger.md)

I consider stoicism amongst my most important personal philosophies.
