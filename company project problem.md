Case 1: 

A company starts a project that will harm the environment. The company president doesn't care, and starts the project.

Case 2:

A company starts a project that will benefit the environment. The company president doesn't care, and starts the project.

---------------

Does the company president [[intent|intend]] harm in the first case? Do they intend benefit in the second? Our questions about intent are wrapped in moral judgment.
