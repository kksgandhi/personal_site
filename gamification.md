Games give you scores, awards, and fun flashing lights when you win. Gamification is taking those things and slapping them on something else. So a gamified classroom would be one where you get a flashing light every time you get a 100 on an exam.

You don't have to turn something into a game in order to gamify it, all you have to do is have an awards / rewards / scoring system.

Buckley and Doyle 2016 found that gamification is better for intrinsically motivated students.

Don't confuse gamification with [[gamefulness]], gamification can be stripped away, [[gamefulness]] cannot
