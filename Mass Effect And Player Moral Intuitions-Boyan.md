Your [[moral foundations theory|moral foundations]] of harm/care [[reverse transference of moral values|determine which game path you'll take]] in [[Mass Effect]].

65% of players according to ME devs chose Paragon. on a scale of -5 to 5 (Renegade to Paragon), mean std = (1.16, 0.8) w/ only 16% less than 0

stepwise regression?

but yeah harm was the only significant one

is harm the most important for our player group or is it the most important in video games or is it just the most important for humans overall?

Maybe people remembering their playing of the game biased their MFT answers? If that were the case, that makes this result even stronger, since it seems that people's playing of the game made them think about moral foundations so much, it affected their thoughts on things unrelated to the game.

Thought: Maybe purity wasn't relevant because it didn't have a lot of gross sections

Reread this to see if it links to [[be yourself, then experiment]]
