[[entrepreneurship]]... it's important!

[[simulation games]] as an alternative [[pedagogy]] for [[entrepreneurship]]

can you teach entrepreneurship? people starting in the 1980s sure thought so.

72 (39m, 33f) Vietnamese students played the [[Coffee Shop game]]

Custom built questionnaires about how well participants did.

"Describe ways that business operations can affect the profits of a company", stuff like that

the scores of the three questions were pairwise t tested.

Were these questions too tailored to the game? Did the students actually learn?

No significant change in perceptions of difficulty, though this section is written in the weirdest way... just not straightforward at all...

Participants basically didn't have any real knowledge of coffee shops or business operations.

Likert scales for perceived competence increases and perceived did you learn came out positive, so there's that.
