The other side is my term for people who are completely dissimilar to me politically, and view the world in a different way to me. I use "the other side" instead of naming a specific political party because I want to be generic and broad as I speak; attaching labels doesn't make anything any more clear and just distracts from the important points.

[[listening to the other side|I know many who do not want to engage with the other side, but my personal belief is that we are forced to live in a world with people who are dangerously dissimilar to us, so understanding their belief system is important.]]
