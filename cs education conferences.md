Learning and CS Education conferences:

 - SIGCSE (Late February)
   - Big conference, CS education research. A bit informal. A bit of pure research, a bit of implementation research ("I did something in my class, here's what worked and what didn't!")
 - ASEE (Late June)
   - Similar to SIGCSE, but more broader STEM and even bigger. Easy to get a paper into apparently.
 - ICER
   - International CS education research. Higher quality and smaller venue than SIGCSE
 - I/ITSEC
   - Simulations, VR, and training for health and military applications
