### Obsidian

[[Obsidian]] lets you visually link your notes, and it's incredible how much it's changed the way I think and the way I take notes. Previously it was "what did the professor say on March 3", and now it's organized far more conceptually and lets me move around far more quickly. I didn't really take notes before I learned about Obsidian and now I apparently have 82 thousand words worth of notes. 

### i3

i3 is a tiling window manager for [[Linux]], essentially it lets you move around, create and destroy, and generally manage windows just by using your keyboard. I can't understate how much i3 has boosted my productivity.

### Linux

[[Linux]] exposes a lot of parts of the OS which allows me to customize it for my own workflow. I think that customizing to the level I have requires some coding knowledge, but I still think everyone should use Linux at the very least to escape the corporate control of our computers.

### rofi

Rofi is more powerful and customizable replacement for Window's start menu and mac's spotlight search

### neovim

With coc and a few other plugins, neovim is a replacement for an IDE and is far more powerful. Even if you don't want to go through the pain of replacing your IDE with neovim, activating the vim modes of various IDEs is really great.
