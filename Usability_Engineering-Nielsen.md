### Chapter 1

Dude just take a fucking field trip to your users

[[Usability]] studies are relatively easy to do and so absurdly useful

Users are always right, but they may not know what they need

Knowledge is a curse

avoid too much [[cognitive load]]

Scenarios? Thinking aloud?

1) recognize the need for usability
2) Make it clear that usability has management support
3) devote resources to usability engineering
4) integrate usability activities into various stages of your development lifecycle
5) Make sure that all user interfaces are subjected to user testing

### Chapter 7

 - In an [[observation]] the observer should be as unintrusive as possible, and avoid helping, since it's all about testing the system's usability.
 - Be neutral in interviews
 - make it easy for them to respond
