Social capital is an unspoken currency that is gained by having a high social standing, or generally being likeable. It is spent by bothering people, or becoming angry.

If someone is angry all the time, they are less likely to be listened to because they have burned all their social capital. Someone who is kind and respectful all the time builds up social capital, and is more likely to be listened to in the times they do get angry.

Cultures who have a history of impoverishment typically also have cultural norms about people checking in on each other, helping neighbors out, etc, because if you are impoverished and help out your community, you can build social capital which you can use in an emergency in lieu of physical capital.
