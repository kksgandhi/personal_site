Is looking for fundamental game elements a sort of [[positivism]]?

The end of the chapter "design as an applied science" has interesting attempts to find the fundamental elements of games, e.g. MDA, Skill Atoms, Game Grammar, 

Simon 1969 calls design an "ill structured problem", see [[wicked problems]] one that is difficult to represent or define. This allows these to withstand scientific methods. Simon suggests ways of transforming these problems into well-formulated problems.

Theories of game design are probably useless, but what about books full of practical exercises? Fullerton's Game Design Workshop or Brathwaite & Schreiber's Challenges for game designers

does [[industry moves too fast for academia|industry move too fast for academia]]?

Here's an idea: study game jams, since they're very very accelerated design schedules

Game aesthetic advancement is usually looked at in the context of hardware advancement, rather than advancement in artistic ideas. Why is it all about shaders, rather than *art*?

Chapter 3 brings up approaches from architecture, like diagramming and sketching that may be a unique way of looking at a game.
