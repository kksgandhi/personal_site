Initial design research were ad-hoc post mortems

[[auteurship|Designers shouldn't be seen as magic artists, but rather craftspeople with a trade]]

Is looking for fundamental game elements a sort of [[positivism]]?

The end of the chapter "design as an applied science" has interesting attempts to find the fundamental elements of games, e.g. MDA, Skill Atoms, Game Grammar, 

Simon 1969 calls design an "ill structured problem", see [[wicked problems]] one that is difficult to represent or define. This allows these to withstand scientific methods. Simon suggests ways of transforming these problems into well-formulated problems.

Theories of game design are probably useless, but what about books full of practical exercises? Fullerton's Game Design Workshop or Brathwaite & Schreiber's Challenges for game designers

does [[industry moves too fast for academia|industry move too fast for academia]]?

Here's an idea: study game jams, since they're very very accelerated design schedules

Game aesthetic advancement is usually looked at in the context of hardware advancement, rather than advancement in artistic ideas. Why is it all about shaders, rather than *art*?

Chapter 3 brings up approaches from architecture, like diagramming and sketching that may be a unique way of looking at a game.

Talks a bit about [[research about design]] and [[research for design]], though I don't really get how the latter is different from simple RtD

RtD suffers from [[academia - bias is baked in|the biases of the lead designer]]

Game conferences ought to accept things that are not papers.

[[action research]]

[[craft]] as opposed to design

talks a bit about [[speculative design]]

The conclusion of chapter 5 is an excellent, excellent summary of what an RtD researcher needs to do.

Chapter 6 talks about a game [[JEU SERAI]], a game built to replace psychological profiling exams.

[[frameworks ought to include uncertainty]].

Chapter 7 (the section titled "current serious game design frameworks") has some fantastic examples of [[transformational game design frameworks]]

Chapter 9 talks about some issues with controlled design experiments, specifically the generalizability and small sample sizes. Do the factors you are varying affect how players play other aspects of the game?
