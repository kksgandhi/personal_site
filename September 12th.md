Shoot missiles at terrorists to kill them, but watch out: If you hit civilians accidentally, their grieving families will become terrorists themselves.

Spoiler: You can't win by blasting the terrorists to bits. For each terrorist you kill, you'll accidentally kill 2 civilians and make 4 new terrorists.

Fantastic game about how our [[military industrial complex]] perpetuates war. In my opinion, it's a great example of "[[teach via rules and outcomes]]" since you can see how a decision to stamp out the terrorists with violence just ends up creating more strife.
