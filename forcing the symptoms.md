A happy family eats dinner together, but a family that eats dinner together is not necessarily happy. I think that people who realize that [[something is wrong]] often put a bandage on things by forcing things into the mold of "appears good."

If things are wrong and forcing the symptoms doesn't work, I think it's an indication that the deeper issues need to be resolved.
