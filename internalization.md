It's funny, sometimes I have a million thoughts on something, I get to writing, and then I write like... a paragraph.

On further thought though, this shouldn't be that surprising. There are so many ideas that are easy to state, but the real challenge of understanding them is in the *internalization* of them. Thinking through all of these ideas' implications and applications, being so familiar with them that you can actually implement them in your life without much thought. 

I feel like reading through [[media]] in general is the easy bit, but if you really want it to improve you, you have to [[critical thinking|critically analyze]] it and understand how it interacts with your life specifically.

I think a lot of philosophy seems obvious, but having a philosophically interesting belief is less about being novel, and more about having the confidence that you've seen it from every angle and still believe it to be true.
