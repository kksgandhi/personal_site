[[reflection]]

From [[Reflection - Framing A Design Landscape-Fleck]]:

 - reflective questions
 - dialog and discussion
 - review of existing material
 - situations that challenge initial assumptions
 - situations that require integrating old and new learning

Supporting various levels of reflection:

 - Support revisiting with technological solutions.
 - Support explanation with reflective questions, questions potentially given by another player or agent. ([[consciousness is just a narrative]])
 - Support perspective shifting with technology to see more than you could by yourself. To compare your data to others. To allow for reorganization of your knowledge / data. Alternative perspectives can be given by agents.

Higher levels are basically the same as lower levels, but more tailored to the goals and scenario.
