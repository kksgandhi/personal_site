The best society is one we'd live in *if we didn't get to choose who we'd be born as*.

A society with slavery is horrible under the veil of ignorance, since if you didn't know whether you'd end up as slave or slaveholder, you'd never want to be born into such a society.

I like the veil of ignorance as a heuristic for [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] calculations.

Using the veil requires some assumptions of equality between people. A slaveholder wouldn't use the veil since they see their slaves as so different to themselves that its nonsensical to wonder how life would be like if they were born a slave.
