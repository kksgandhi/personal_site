There's no good way to write this... at best it'll sound like a bad dating profile, and at worst it'll sound like an arrogant love letter to myself... I'll try my best, but if you really want to get to know me, don't read my website, just talk to me in person.

I think one of my core beliefs is [[diversity]]. I like [[do things|doing as many things as possible and meeting as many people as possible]] because I feel like that's the only real way to learn about the world.

In my free time I like hanging out with as many different people as will tolerate me, [[rock climbing]], [[DnD]], [[biking]], [[board games]], [[geocaching]], exploring using the [[Atlas Obscura]] and obviously [[games|video games]]

[[stuff worth reading|Other things I like enough to have thoughts about it]]

**Note: If you do want to go deeper into the site, please remember, this website contains *all* my notes, as is. It's the ramblings of a madman, not a bastion of information. Take it as it is, don't assume that I stand strongly by anything written, and please actually talk to me in person â€” nuance is hard to portray in a medium like this.**
