# FUN FACTS

* The brain uses 25% of its processing and 60% of the cerebral cortex for vision

# History

* Many ancient theories assumed that the eye itself was emitting something, though ancient philosophers like Aristotle did correctly believe that fiery items created particles that reflected into the eyes.
* The first serious literature on it was Ibn Al-Haytham's Book of Optics
* affordances were first described by Norman's The Psychology of Everyday Things
