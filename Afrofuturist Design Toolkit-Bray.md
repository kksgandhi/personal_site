focusing specifically on how they validated / brainstormed their toolkit:

 - 4 virtual brainstorming meetings led by community design experts
 - Gave the current version of the toolkit along with an earlier "ideation workbook"
 - visioning exercises, looking at tenents they wanted to support.
 - When describing the design process, they mention that each design session had a different focus, but it's unclear whether the session was *created* with that focus, or if that's just what organically came up during that session.
 - They then did 27 interviews to see how designers would use the toolkit, what the impact would be on their design.
