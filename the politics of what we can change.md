I have complex opinions on a lot of political topics. At the same time... I'm literally never going to be in a position to enact some of my ideas, so I'm not going to waste time thinking about something that won't ever actually change the way I act.

Like, I've seen a pamphlet telling Leninists that they should be anarchists instead, and all I can think about is "why does that level of granularity in labels matter when we don't even have universal healthcare." If someone is voting and protesting for good, [[actions speak louder than words|I couldn't care less what their actual beliefs are]].

Similarly, there are times [[politics as values or actions|when I take actions I don't 100% believe in]], because I'm focused on the things I can change with the power I personally have.
