Coding is a simplistic process on the surface, but there are a lot of complex frameworks built around the notion. Annoyingly, I don't think these complex frameworks actually teach you how to do it better (or present your ideas better), they just add jargon that muddies the water.

Nonetheless, [[thematic analysis]] (specifically Braun and Clark's works) are good places to start, with [[Coding Manual For Qualitative Researchers-Saldana|the coding manual]] existing if you want to get into the nitty gritty.

[[grounded theory - coding|coding is a primary part of grounded theory, this note talks about how to use it there specifically.]]
