[[small group discussions]]

Mostly from "Teaching at its best, Nilson":

 - Cold calling people is fine, just give them an escape hatch
 - Prevent students from participating too much or too little. Maybe even use physical tokens

Spontaneous debate. Have students argue for the opposite side.

End classes with a 1 minute paper, where they write what they learned and any confusion they still have.
