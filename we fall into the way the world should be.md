When we are traumatized, we assume that's the way the world works and perpetuate the cycle of trauma or seek out people who were like our abusers, since at least we understand them, we understand that way of living.

When we are [[stereotypes|stereotyped]], we can't break away from the idea that that's how we're supposed to act, so it's just easier to act that way.

We fall into our own self image. Fake it till you make it I guess.
