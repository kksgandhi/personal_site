Should games be played before, during, or after instruction. Apparently they should be played as advance organizers, whatever the heck that means

[[advance organizer]]

few teachers actually use games for teaching, most just use it as a break or a reward

some interesting papers here on educational sequencing.

[[PLF]]

studied 11 year olds on a game that taught algebraic properties and single variable linear equations

used a game called [[DragonBox Algebra]]

Honestly, take this paper and actually try to understand the stats of it all. Jesus

Using a game as an [[advance organizer]] allowed players to ground their understanding and gave the instructor things to refer back to.
