If you build a cabinet, you can look at your work with pride. You have a tangible achievement for your hard work.

If you modify spreadsheets all day, it's much harder to point to what you actually did. Of course you can explain why your job is important to the company, how you improved profits by a percent of a percent, but that's so much more abstract than building a cabinet.

Since workers are so divorced from the actual products of their work, this leads to ennui and alienation.
