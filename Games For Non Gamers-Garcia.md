This is all about making critical games that target non-gamers

Least enjoyable aspects:

 - repetitiveness
 - disconnect between game affordances and expectations
 - tutorial design is important, ofc

drivers to continue playing:

 - diversity of gameplay
 - thought provoking narratives
 - [[relating the message to the player increases its power|similarity to their own lives]]
 - some level of challenge, though likely less than most gamers would want
   - difficulty is fine as long as there is something driving them to keep playing

Keep in mind the issues relevant to your target audiences. This paper found that age affected what political topics were salient

From some workshops:

 - Non gamers enjoy games that deal with issues in the news cycle
 - enjoyed a variety of short, simple tasks
 - low skill, quick internalization
 - enjoyed meaningful choice
