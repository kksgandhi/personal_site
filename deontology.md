Random notes:

 - The [[doctrine of double effect]] is a good deontological response to many consequentialist thought experiments. e.g. is it ok to pull the lever? Yes, because killing the 1 is *collateral damage*, not the intended outcome
 - Social Contract theory provides a good response to "breaking rules". You can lie to the murderer, you can kill baby Hitler, because they are breaking the social contract and thus are not protected by it
 - the [[golden rule]] differs from the [[categorical imperative]]
