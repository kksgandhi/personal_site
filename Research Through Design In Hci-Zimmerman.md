Starts by defining designers, design research, and design thinking.

Background:

Sch√∂n argues that designers ought to reflect on their design.

The background has a lot more, but it's not super relevant to me

How can design research be useful to the HCI community?

 - in service of a research community, helping researchers frame problems and communicate impact (tbh I have no idea what they mean by this)
 - critics, building critical artifacts
 - finding patterns that lead to pattern languages.

Interaction designers synthesize technology (from engineers), human data (from anthropologists), and theory (from behavioral scientists) to create artifacts. These artifacts transfer HCI research to the practice community (industry)

Has some examples, including a XEROX machine, Philips concepts for the future, and Apple's guides

I liked this paper, though I wish it had a bit more practical guidance on how to present research through design to conferences / explain how thin to [[salami slicing|slice the salami]]
