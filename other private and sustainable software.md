For email, I personally use [hey](https://www.hey.com/), which has some nice power-user features in a pretty package, but I've also heard really good things about [proton mail](https://proton.me/mail). Proton in general looks like a *great* Google replacement. They have a calendar, drive, password manager, etc.

For search engines, Duck Duck Go has been beating my expectations, to the point where I often like the DDG results over the Google results. I sometimes do use Google as a backup, but I don't necessarily think Google has better results, just different ones.
