How can you evaluate an RTD project? Also from [[Research Through Design In Hci-Zimmerman]]:

 - is the process they used documented and rigorous?
 - did they take the existing literature and extend it to something new?
 - relevance. What is the current state, your motivation, and how does this artifact push the world to a preferred state? (this section also talks about how designers shouldn't worry about reproduceability)
 - extensibility; can the work be used and built upon?

How generalizable is your artifact's design? Test via making variations, e.g. [[evocative experiments]]
