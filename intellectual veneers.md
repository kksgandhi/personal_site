I fear that ideologies that purport to be intellectual and objective are merely veneers that distract from the fact that biases do exist in interpretation.

For example supporters of objectivism and orginalism often laud a sort of intellectual superiority over their opponents who simply "don't see things as rationally as they do." Not to say that all supporters do, but there are definitely some.

[[PhilosophyTube]] has [a good video on objectivism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNhj_s8flUk)
