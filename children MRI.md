*VR* game for *children* inside an *MRI* scanner

www.vr-rlx.com

since players have to be still, not much movement in the game. But big world

* Slow pacing, no movement
  * You can't move in MRI
* Big environment
  * Avoid *claustrophobia* of MRI
* Auto-passive mode
  * children may not understand how to play

No actual empirical evaluation yet. Heck, they haven't even built it inside a real MRI machine yet.
