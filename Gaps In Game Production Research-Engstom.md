Content Production
------------------

Design is the production sub-category best represented in Academic Literature.

The technical perspective on game development is well represented in the material, but mainly from a management perspective. There is a large gap in terms of the content production perspective on programming. (Honestly not sure what they mean)

audio and narrative are missing studies, the "content production" section has some interesting ideas for research.

The section "The DiGRA perspective" has some discussion on how papers identify industry empirics, and identify a few papers that interview developers. May be worth future reading.

Few studies focus on particular professions.

Audio is missing a lot, "there are however almost no empirical studies of writing in game productions"

"Discussion and Conclusion" have some previous studies that also discuss the industry / academia gap
