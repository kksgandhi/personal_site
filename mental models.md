From Laurie Levesque: there is the issue of novice versus expert mental models; the unspoken decisions that experts may make, and be unaware of the factors that went into the decision making process. This may skew data collected from think alouds unless there are novices asking the experts to fill in the 'leaps of logic' that are intuitive to the latter and not obvious to the former.
