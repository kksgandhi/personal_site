Fall 2021:

 - Will robots destroy the world?
   - Robots may destroy the planet, but probably not like they did in The Terminator. Come find out what future robots will look like, whether they will think like you or I, and whether you should be afraid of them. **This class does not require a computer science background**

 - You don't exist
   - I'm sorry, you don't exist. Unfortunate that you had to find out this way. Are you sure you do? Well, come by and prove me wrong. In this class we'll discuss the philosophy of you, me, and the self. Who are you, what are you made of. Are you sure you're not a particularly clever robot? I'd tell you to sign up, but of course, you don't exist.

Spring 2022:

 - How to be happy
   - There's no single key to happiness, but many have tried to find some light in a chaotic world. In this class, we'll look at some of the most famous theories - absurdism, stoicism, buddhism - and use them to think about our own situations.
   - 5 signups
 - Cracking conspiracies
   - The earth isn't flat, so why do so many people think it is? In this class we'll break into the psychology of flat earthers, false flaggers, and bigfoot hunters.

Fall 2022:

 - Who's afraid of red, yellow, and blue?
   - The Nazi's didn't just burn books, they burned art, too. Why is art such a big deal? Why do some pieces of art sell for millions while others pieces are viewed as "degenerate"? Can video games be considered art, and ultimately, who are the people afraid of red, yellow, and blue?

   - Not too many takers
 - Let's make games
   - So many games sound fun, but end up being total snoozefests. Why are games so hard to make? In this class we'll make our own games while talking about what makes a game good, bad, or downright ugly.

 - Do your own research!
   - Let's be real, the conspiracy theorists got one thing right: everyone is trying to manipulate you, especially the rich and powerful. Uncovering the truth about the world requires research, but research is a lot more complicated than clicking articles on Facebook. This class goes over bias, how research actually works, and how to find the truth about real world issues. (22 registered)

Spring 2025

 - Violence
	 - Hitting someone is a violent act... unless it's in self defense. Shooting someone is a violent act... unless you wear a badge. Why are some people labeled violent terrorists, while others are gritty freedom fighters? This class is about the concepts of violence and power; we'll talk through the philosophy and ethics of how power is used and abused.
 - Non-Violence
	 - Through history, non-violent movements have been the best way to create change... but there's a lot they don't teach you about MLK and Gandhi. How does non-violent action work, and how can we help each other when our political systems fail?
