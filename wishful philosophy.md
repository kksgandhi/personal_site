There are many philosophers who have talked about how negative things such as [[death]], pain, or [[sadness]] give life meaning, and are ultimately important for humans to experience to be fully realized.

I feel odd about that though... I wonder if these philosophers are just saying that because they are afraid of [[death]], or [[sadness]], and try to ascribe meaning to [[the absurd]] just so that they can feel better about it.

Since I feel on [[the precipice]], I'm afraid that [[futurism]] and [[immortality]] will be stymied by an unconscious feeling that humans deserve to be mortal, and I feel like breaking that unconscious belief is incredibly necessary to allow [[futurism]] to take hold.
