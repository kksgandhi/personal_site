#doctoralConsortium [[educational game literature reviews]]

I like this review a lot, only problem is that they really conflated "gamification" and "gamefulness" when talking about the efficacy of educational games.

 - [[PBL]] is effective for motivation, but "the cognitive impact" is not significant.
   - Competition is controversial because of its negative impacts
 - Feedback, including emotional feedback, is important and needs to be timed well.
   - There's a bit more that's pretty interesting, come back if I'm specifically looking at feedback.
 - [[the game environment should match the real world|A game environment similar to the real world can help with learning.]]
 - Fun and easy games improve learning outcomes
 - Games allow teachers to be a bit more hands off, though teacher support is still massively beneficial.
 - Edugames can provide data about how students are learning, which teachers can then use.
 - interesting challenge can motivate players.
 - Edugames can benefit:
   - hand-eye coordination
   - problem-solving
   - emotional regulation
 - [[games provide a safe space for experimentation|Games teach by having safe environments]]
 - games promote cooperation
 - RPGs are cool
 - Getting students to build their own games is effective.
 - Games can be multimedia, bringing in websites or videos.
 - future games can be increasingly adaptive.
 - edugame research should focus on neuroscientific studies of how people learn with games.
