Everyone deserves love and compassion, and with love and compassion, anyone can grow into an amazing person.

But...

 - You only have so much love and compassion you can give out. There are only 24 hours in a day.
 - Not everyone will accept your compassion. Some people will hate you just for the fact that you are kind.
 - Love and compassion come second, first you need to prevent people from hurting others or hurting themselves.
