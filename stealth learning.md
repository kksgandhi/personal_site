Well designed stealth learning can avoid [[chocolate covered broccoli]], but this may lead to players not properly associating in game learning with the real world.

I'm not actually convinced this is as large of an issue as [[Reflective Game Design-Khaled]] makes it out to be... The paper brings up an example of a spy game teaching cryptography that players don't associate with the real world, but maybe they will? As long as the spy game [[teach via rules and outcomes|accurately simulates real world cryptography enough]] that players can recognize the patterns, then learning is being done.
