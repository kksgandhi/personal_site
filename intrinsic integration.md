Merely adding gameplay to a boring task won't make it fun or effective, just like adding chocolate to broccoli won't make it tasty. You need to your gameplay to align with and support the themes that you are trying to portray.

To take out the learning content would be to take out the game itself. The opposite of [[ludopedagogical dissonance]]

Also known as: [[endogenous design]]

For example, [[Review Of Trends In Serious Gaming For Education-Young]] found that a history game was ineffective. The game added the historical information as "interesting tidbits" on top of the game, rather than having the history be important to the gameplay itself.
