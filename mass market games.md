[[Reflective Elements In Mass-Market Games-Gandhi]] had this working definition:

Games that were publicly available through commercial distribution avenues with promotional / marketing materials, implying that these games were designed to appeal to a broad audience.

This definition is pretty limited since it conflates [[indie games]] and [[AAA]] games.
