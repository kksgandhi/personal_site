[[AI]]

[[consciousness]]

"Asking if an AI is truly intelligent is like asking if a submarine can swim. Maybe it can, maybe it can't, but it doesn't really matter." (I don't remember where I found this quote).

I don't care if an AI is truly conscious, it can still cause a lot of harm / shake up the world.
