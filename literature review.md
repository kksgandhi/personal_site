A good tool for literature reviews is https://www.connectedpapers.com/

No need to search through references, go to google scholar, and go through a bunch of clicks to see if a reference is worth your time. Connected papers has the related paper abstracts already there for you. Plus since it searches based on verbal similarity instead of pure references, it can give you access to a lot of related work the author might have failed to put in the related work section (or work that might not have existed when the author wrote the related work section)
