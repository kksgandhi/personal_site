So I have a definition of abusive games, but this paper has a slightly different definition: [[abusive game design]]#. I do think the things I categorize as [[abusive games]] do count, their definition is just broader.

Discusses [[Dark Room Sex Game]]

Games aim to satisfy players desires, but [[immersion is counter to reflection|perhaps that stands counter to critically interacting with a game]]

describes conventional game design: [[player advocacy]]

lol the paper says that there are no abusive games.

 - abusive game design is a design philosophy that can lead to abusive game experiences. The actual game is secondary in the disucssion
 - abusive game design is an aesthetic position by the designer.
 - The game is only a mediator in the dialogue between the designer and player.

Despite them saying there are no abusive games, I'm adding the games they mention to my list on [[abusive games]] lmao

They have a good example with Kaizo mario, pointing out that oftentimes beating that game requires you to understand specific [[game design affordances]] unique to Kaizo, reminding you that the designer is out there and hates you.

Interesting discussions on [[bleed]]

A game can't abuse their players if they quit. Kaizo is imaginative, beatable, unique. Anyone can make a near impossible Mario level, but Kaizo is interesting enough to get people to continue.
