I hate the phrase "Oh it's just facts", because while facts can't be false, the facts you choose to present and how you present them can absolutely display a bias.

For example, it is a fact that impoverished people commit more violent crimes than richer individuals, but using this to imply that impoverished people are worse people than richer individuals is biased and misrepresenting the situation.
