3 Act:

Act 2: Explain how Businessman brings up discussion of fragility. Haydn and the Oyster brings up higher and lower pleasures. Ask how we can avoid fragility, and how higher and lower pleasures interact w/ Fragility
Act 3: A lot of discussion around higher and lower pleasures revolves around Buddhist ideas of going with the flow. Why are these ideas so hard to implement, why do they sound trite?
