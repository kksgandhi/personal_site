*gamification* is more effective when tailored to end users. Tailor to *personality types*. Big Five Inventory, BFI-44 + BFI-10

gamification user types using Hexad

Big Five and Hexad only validated with adults, is it valid with adolescents?

Issues with application to adolescents?? Models may be okay, instruments might be not that great.

user types aren't really implemented in platforms right now, but questionnaires could change which gamification elements could be used

participants thought of questions differently depending on *context*. Explicitly math questions were thought about differently.
