Games are scholarly works in their own right.

Conceptual games present human information that can't be presented textually. [[internalization|Lots of knowledge can't be presented textually]], for example, knowing what discrimination is, definitionally, is very different from knowing what discrimination feels like.

Sculptures and pictures like Fountain and the Treachery of Images say something about sculpture and picture, respectively. Can games say things about games?

Philosophical conceptual games - games that experientially communicate a philosophical idea.

conceptual games can also be socio-political or self-reflexive (about game design).

Games like Syobon No Action and Beginner's Guide comment on philosophical ideas, while stuff like Game Feel Demos, The Metagame (not the card game you're thinking of), Necessary Evil, The Game of Video Game Objects, and Doors talk about games more specifically.
