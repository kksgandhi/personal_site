[[games provide a safe space for exploration of emotion]]

[[serious experience]]

asked people to write about their emotional experiences, also gave them the [[PENS]] survey. They then noted that PENS might be limited since they are curious about emotional appreciation which can be unfun, so they also used a questionnaire by Bartsch about emotional gratification in entertainment (wasn't built for games though).

More autonomy correlated with more happiness. More character engagement correlated with sadness.

 - Players felt loss in their games
 - Players felt attached to their characters.

   - [[reducing agency]] caused negative emotions, but made existing choices more meaningful
 - achievement was emotionally moving
 - the atmosphere was emotionally moving
 - players related emotional game experiences with life experiences
 - emotionally moving moments triggered [[games - reflection|reflection]]
 - [[forced out of character actions]]
