[[educational game literature reviews]]

Points out that cross-disciplinary approaches are necessary to understand educational games, and looks at the literature from the angle of various disciplines.

 - Wave 1 of educational games involved a lot of setting definitions in association with [[constructivism]]
 - Wave 2 focused on "serious games" and also took place when a lot of the "[[violent video games|video games are violent]]!" panic was happening.
 - Wave 3 focused on commercial off the shelf games and the fact that [[edugames don't fit well into the classroom structure]].

A lot of trials showing that games are beneficial.

Wouters (2013) found that games are more effective in teaching and learning, but were not found to be motivating.

Summary:

 - the literature is scattered.
 - [[edugames don't fit well into the classroom structure]]
 - in game feedback needs work
 - balance between playability, fun, and learning objectives
