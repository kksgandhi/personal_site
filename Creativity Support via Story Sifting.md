Summary
-------

 - Narrative as a co-creative domain (humans and AI can work together) ([[co-creative design]])
 - studying communities of playful storytellers and what they need
 - technology that supports human creators

------

 - creativity is hard
   - [[design is interconnected|design decisions have far reaching ripple effects]]
   - creativity space is vast
   - [[it's hard to evaluate design|evaluating creative work is hard]]
   - easy to get [[writer's block]]

Why is design fun? Let's find out and apply it to other things

Narrative design is a good example of the problems in design generally

supporting [[emergent narrative games]]

[[reversal in stories]]

having strong character motivations is better for emergent narrative rather than random character motivations.

interactive narrative games need help:

 - figuring out what comes next (actually nah, these games are good at hitting you with events)
 - maintaining consistency

![[story sifting]]

Threw some interns at [[Felt - language]] and found that they could use the language easily, but didn't make programs that really caught all types of stories.

[[Winnow - language]]

why are we like this - another tool that I didn't fully understand

Questions
---------

How does the strong character motivations affect Stellaris and Civ?

How did you choose the language for Felt?

In Felt, does the computer just create random stories and ask the player if they like that story?
