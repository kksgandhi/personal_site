 - playtest early and often
 - your players aren't stupid
 - don't intervene
 - think aloud
 - "How would you describe this game?"
 - Players know their feelings, you know the solutions.

 - What was the most frustrating moment or aspect of what you just played?
 - What was your favorite moment or aspect of what you just played?
 - Was there anything you wanted to do that you couldn’t?
 - If you had a magic wand to wave, and you could change, add, or remove anything from the experience, what would it be?
 - What were you doing in the experience?
 - How would you describe this game to your friends and family?
 - What could have been explained better or earlier when I was teaching the game?
 - What do you wish you knew when you first started playing?
 - Is there anything you feel like you still don’t understand, even after finishing the game?
 - What was missing from the player boards / reference cards?
 - What did you want to do, but couldn’t or was unable to do?
 - Were your decisions meaningful, or did they feel like they didn’t matter?
 - What were you asked to memorize / internalize / recall? Was this too much for a game like this?
 - How would you describe your strategy?
 - What other strategies did you see or think of?
 - Did you notice a first or last player advantage?
 - Did you notice a dominant strategy?
 - What kind of emotions or feelings did you feel / notice as you played?
 - What brought those emotions out, the game or another player?
 - Which elements helped you feel immersed in the theme of the game?
 - Which elements took you out of the game’s theme?
 - What moments were the most fun? What moments felt like work, or were boring?
 - What felt balanced or unbalanced? (Remember we’re focusing on feelings here, not the raw math of things.)
 - Did you notice any accessibility issues? (Examples: color-blindness, required cultural knowledge, high cognitive load, lots of memory elements, etc.)
 - How long did the game feel (too short, too long, just right)?
 - Did the mechanics work well with the theme?
