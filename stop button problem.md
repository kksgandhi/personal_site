 - AI won't let you hit the stop button
   - Add "allow stop to utility function"
 - AI hits its own stop button
   - "tell it it can't hit the stop button"
 - AI makes you hit the stop button OR convinces you that it is safe in times where it's in a testing environment
   - Make the AI just not care about the button
 - AI makes a subagent that isn't bound by the same safety principles.
