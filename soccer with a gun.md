Soccer has a goal: Get the ball in the net. It also has rules: Use your feet, no going out of bounds, etc.

What if you kept the goal, dropped the rules? Then the best way to play soccer would be to bring a gun. Wave your gun around, shoot opposing players if necessary, and slowly take the ball towards the net.

There's a lot of discussion about how the rules of games can be limiting, but there's a surprising way in which they are freeing: They prevent players from bringing guns to their soccer games, and allow players to explore the vast world of non-gun related soccer strategies.
