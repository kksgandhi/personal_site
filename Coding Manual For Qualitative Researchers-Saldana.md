[[qualitative analysis]]
[[thematic analysis]]

coding is not the only way to do qualitative analysis.

coding is hierarchical, categories, codes, and subcodes

codes are short, themes are sentences

don't code just for themes, themes are a side effect of good coding

it's ok not to code everything, but be conservative in what you cut until you have a good sense of what's important

break up the text for your own sanity

precode, highlight important information

Number of codes varies on the project, and different researchers have said different things about expected number of codes. A coder can only handle 30-40 at a time, especially if they are developed by someone else.

how to make a [[codebook]]

refers to a type of software called CAQDAS. pg 29 (pdf page 52) has a list of CAQDAS software

[[inter-rater reliability]]

No more than 5 people coding to avoid issues of [[social groups]]

Thesaurus your codes

your coding process likely shouldn't go into your paper, but perhaps an appendix or "on request" sort of deal is good

[[analytical memos]]

Other methods of qualitative analysis: [[performance ethnography]] and [[narrative inquiry]]

An unexpected, but very poignant note on [[identity]]

if you are using a priori codes, you have to think deeply about what they mean in your specific context / field

When doing exploratory work, you can often code with different styles one after the other to get a better perspective on the data.

First Cycle coding methods:

 - [[attribute coding]]
 - [[structural coding]] or [[holistic coding]]
 - [[descriptive coding]]
 - [[in vivo coding]], [[initial coding]], and / or [[values coding]]

Second Cycle coding methods:

 - [[eclectic coding]]
 - [[pattern coding]] and/or [[focused coding]]

Other coding methods

 - [[magnitude coding]]
 - [[hierarchical coding]]
 - [[simultaneous coding]]
