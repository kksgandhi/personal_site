Victoria Grieves argues that games can't really foster empathy. Here are some articles she gave me on the topic:

Ruberg, B. (2020). Empathy and its alternatives: Deconstructing the rhetoric of “empathy” in video games. _Communication, Culture & Critique_, _13_(1), 54-71.  

Another big one I used was this:

[https://www.vice.com/en/article/empathy-games-dont-exist/](https://www.vice.com/en/article/empathy-games-dont-exist/)  

Mostly it comes down to us humanities folks chipping away at the rhetoric of tech-focused folks to bring it in line with reality. lol

A newer article that I think should be part of this conversation is this one:

Hugaas, K. H. (2024). Bleed and Identity: A conceptual model of bleed and how bleed-out from role-playing games can affect a player’s sense of self. _International Journal of Role-Playing_, (15), 9-35.  

Essentially, "bleed" is a well known concept in TTRPG spaces that, I believe, describes a phenomenon closer to empathy.

Hope that helps!
