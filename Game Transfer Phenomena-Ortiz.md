[[game transfer phenomena]]

 - players become dissociated in games
 - players dreamed / daydreamed about games
 - players saw real life objects and thought about (or saw, in an optical illusion sense) video game elements.
 - Players would take real life actions as if they were in game actions, e.g. walking like a video game character or wanting to press keyboard buttons to access real life objects
 - players gamified their own lives, applying points
 - players referenced games in conversation or did actions with friends inspired by games
 - thought about taking violent / dangerous actions, as one would in a game to solve problems
 - feared that they might face danger in real life, just as one would in a game
