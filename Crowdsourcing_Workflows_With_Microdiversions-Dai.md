 - participants get bored after a while
 - if they think it's for a charity, they do better
 - strategy advice as well is helpful
 - tasks can cause poor performance not by being taxing, but by causing [[boredom]]
   - that said workers in [[mturk]] are allowed to switch tasks, so it's not a problem for them

Research questions:

 1) Do cairns increase worker retention?
   1) workers are free to swap tasks, and do so quickly. Is the cognitive cost of switching a task more than a [[cairns]]?
 2) Performance benefits?
 3) Are different tasks affected differently?

If someone stays, they're considered engaged, since they could have just left

[[Wikipedia]] article quality rating, [[Freebase]] entity merging and [[image analysis]] are the tasks people were given

Should diversions be 
 a) different tasks
 b) forced breaks
 c) games?

They chose (c), though (a) and (b) could be #futureWork. 

One diversion was a dice game where you can bet some of the money you've made so far.

Another was a story, split out throughout the mega task

Users could skip over tasks, they came approx. every 10 minutes

Wikipedia rating? Workers had 20% more retention with story and game

Freebase entities? Story had a similar impact, but game did nothing, probably because FE was too cognitive

Image analysis was the most interesting, less retention at first, but more retention over time.

Microdiversions (cairns) don't affect task accuracy

what's the interaction between task type (heavy cognitive load or not) and cairn type? Looks like similar task types probably work better
