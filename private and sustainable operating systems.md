You've probably heard of Windows and macOS. Linux is a competitor that, like Wikipedia, is built entirely by volunteers and isn't controlled by any corporation. Despite not having a company backing it, it runs the variety of websites and servers in the world.

Linux has an association for being techy, but modern Linux is very very easy to use, doubly so if you have a laptop known to work well with Linux, like a [Framework](https://frame.work/) or System76. The exception is if you run specialized software like Adobe's suite of media editing software or Microsoft Office and aren't willing to use alternatives (like alternative media editors, or Google Docs).

If you have an old laptop, Linux will refresh it, and it's a great way to try it out without committing.

Getting a new operating system on your mobile phone is a bit easier, though you'll be missing cutting edge features. I've personally used [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) and currently have [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) (only for Pixel phones); both are great!
