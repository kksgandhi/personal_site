You've probably heard of Windows and macOS. Linux is a competitor that, like Wikipedia, is built entirely by volunteers and isn't controlled by any corporation. Despite not having a company backing it, it runs the variety of websites and servers in the world.

Linux has an association for being techy, but **the vast majority of people will be perfectly fine if they get a machine designed to run Linux** such as a [Framework](https://frame.work/) or System76 (or if they get a techy friend to install it on a laptop known to work well with Linux). The exception is if you run specialized software like Adobe's suite of media editing software or Microsoft Office and aren't willing to use alternatives (like alternative media editors, or Google Docs).

Getting a new operating system on your mobile phone is a bit tougher, and I probably wouldn't recommend it to most. That said, I've personally used [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) and have heard great things about [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) (only for Pixel phones).
