People don't believe in science because, to them, science isn't a process for truth, it's headlines in tabloids: "Science says drinking a glass of wine extends your lifespan!!!"

If science is a process that aims to find the truth, then its blindingly obvious we should follow it, but science can also be a dogmatic institution prone to politiking, a cudgel of [[false objectivity]] used to beat those you don't believe in.
