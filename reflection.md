It seems that Sch√∂n's reflection in action and reflection on action is usually cited, but Mezirow's critical self reflection is also used. See critical self reflection in [[Self Reflection Through Roleplay In Chimeria Grayscale-Ortiz]], they have a definition by Dewey though imo it's wordy and unhelpful. I'm personally a fan of Fleck and Fitzpatrick's framework...
