[[frameworks|Our brain naturally chunks things into concepts and frameworks.]] If we didn't do that, we'd go insane. Imagine trying to think about cooking without having a concept of what a vegetable is. Just like we have the concept of a door, or a shoe, our brains have concepts of more abstract philosophical ideas. I'm confident that you have a concept in your brain that approximates to "utilitarianism", you just may not have heard about that word before.

These common words make it easier to communicate. You can go your whole life with complex philosophical thoughts, but when you try to talk with others, it becomes infinitely easier if you can just say "oh yeah, that's like utilitarianism" (assuming the other person knows what it is, of course.)

[[pretentiousness|Unfortunately, some people do hide behind jargon as a way to make themselves sound intelligent.]]

[[effing the ineffable|Some philosophers just say what everyone already knows, but in fancier writing. Sometimes though, that's an important and impressive skill.]]
