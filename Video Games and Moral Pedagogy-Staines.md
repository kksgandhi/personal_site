[[games can teach philosophy through interaction]]

Discusses [[Neo-Kohlbergianism]], starts with an intro on how Kohlberg came up with his theories on moral development.

[[moral competency]]

Apparently [[Ultima IV]] uses [[moral dilemmas]] in its character creation. Recommends that UIV could have used consequences (aka [[mechanical morality systems|skill points]]) and [[modify moral dilemmas|repeatedly modifying moral dilemmas]]

[[games are contextless]]

talks about how [[Fallout 3]] uses more [[moral temptations]] than moral dilemmas, which is a fair point, though I think what FO3 is trying to do is allow for a player to choose to be a wanton madman if they want to be. Talks further about how FO3 could be improved by adding emotional depth to the characters who provide the moral temptations, and just generally adding nuance.

Talks about another quest (Oasis) that's a lot better.

Talks a bit about [[scaffolding]]

Talks a bit about Navaez's [[integrated ethics education]], but doesn't really go to deep into it.

Are [[mechanical morality systems]] that bad? People still understand the consequences and such.

 - [[prosocial game claims bolster violent video game claims]]
 - integrated ethics education is great, but doesn't talk about whether it should be groups or solo, lesson structure, and metrics.
 - what game genre and type work best?
