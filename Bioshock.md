In Bioshock, you have the opportunity to save the little girls or sacrifice them for a power boost. This is a neat mechanic, but it's ruined because you later get the power boost even if you did save them. This turns a neat moral mechanic into a [[mechanical morality systems|mechanical morality system]], and a bad one at that.
