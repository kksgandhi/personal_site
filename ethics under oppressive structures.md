[[structural problems]] surround us, but we [[mister gotcha|have to engage with these structures to live reasonably.]] It would be silly to say you have to be a hermit who never buys anything in order to critique your country's economic system.

In fact, attempting to interact with a system in an ethical way opens up criticisms ala [[Copenhagen Ethics]].

So how do we separate a [[we are all immoral|reasonable level of unethical living]] from [[hypocrisy]]?

For example, my lab pays people to do [[microwork]], and I believe that we pay people a fair wage. At the same time, I think that microwork is inherently problematic, along with the larger systems that it is a part of. Am I a hypocrite for thinking so, while continuing to encourage microwork? Should I cease interacting with microwork platforms altogether? Our microwork platform of choice (mechanical turk) allows us to set a good wage, but what if there are aspects of mturk that I don't like and can't control, is my only option to step away from mturk altogether? Are the problems of microwork useless to try and solve when [[tangible problems nested in structural problems|there are larger structural problems]] of capitalism?

[[It's not necessarily hypocritical to be unethical in an unethical system]]
