**The short notes I've written for each channel don't do them justice, I would really suggest looking into them yourself**

### PhilosophyTube

Politics, identity, the issues with modern life

### Kurzgesagt

Typically more science than philosophy, but "The Egg" and "Optimistic Nihilism" are some of the best videos on Youtube

### exurb1a

A bit crude and informal, but some of the best work on happiness and meaning. I suggest "You probably don't exist" and "Meaning is a jumper you have to knit yourself" since their other videos are more poetry than relaxing videos.

### Jacob Geller

Art, Games, and how art can help us in our search for meaning

### Contrapoints

Identity, GSRM issues, and politics

### Innuendo Studios

Psychology, Politics, and Political psychology. Fantastic videos on [[the other side]].

### Folding Ideas

"In search of a flat earth" is literally the best video I've seen on [[conspiracy theories]]

### Big Joel

A bit disorganized and ranty, but still good political videos

### T1J

Race and politics

### Hbomberguy

I don't know how to feel about Hbomberguy... He makes really good videos explaining global warming, and why the earth isn't flat, etc... but I don't personally need those videos. I'm more interested in stuff like Folding Ideas' "In Search of a Flat Earth", but I still think hbomberguy deserves to be on here.
