uses the [[WarVG-A]] war game analysis tool to analyze the critical thinking towards war. Honestly the abstract wasn't that great so I'm hoping the rest of the paper is.

Do war games [[the banality of evil|banalize war]]?

I mean yes, and this paper identifies a variety of mechanics that make war seem simpler than it actually is.

Looked at a variety of games from different lenses / dimensions

 - cognitive: How does the game treat the US and terrorist groups?
 - personal: what viewpoints is the player given? Just soldiers, or civilians as well?
 - ethical: transmitted values such as empathy, or racial views
 - logical: how much of the surrounding motivations and backgrounds does the game show?
 - argumentative: does the game present the conflict as justified?
