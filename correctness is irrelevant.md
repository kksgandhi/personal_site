What if someone came up to you, entirely convinced that $2+2=5$. You'd be confident that they were wrong, you might even try convincing them otherwise, but I'd bet you'd have a ton of other thoughts as well. How did they come to this conclusion? How do they live with such a weird belief system? Is there just a miscommunication between the two of you?

I used to think everyone who didn't "believe" in climate change was stupid. I didn't think anything past "I am right and they are wrong". Of course I still think that climate change is real, but I think a huge turning point in my maturity was when I started to ask deeper questions about why there were so many people who held "the objectively wrong" belief, and what I'd do with that information.

I was once looking for a girl and described her as "fat". My friends all gave me crap for it, but I didn't understand. It was just a descriptor, one that was accurate. Why not use it? There's a lot more to things than being technically correct.

People often try to win arguments by being technically correct. Stop trying to be correct, and start [[ironmanning]]

 - Why do people believe the things they do?
 - If I'm convinced I'm right, what right or responsibility do I have to push my views onto them?
