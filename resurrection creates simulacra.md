A mummy, preserved in a museum is a simulacra. It is real â€” it's a real mummy in every sense of the world, but it's also a simulation of a mummy sitting in a tomb. The fact that we've put this mummy outside it's natural context, protected it from harm, is where the simulation comes in.

We resurrect when we embalm the past, but why this obsession with resurrection? Because society "dreams of order", it wants a clear past and a continuum, as sort of reassurance about its future.
