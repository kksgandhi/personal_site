For someone with large swaths of his website dedicated to philosophy, I haven't read too many books on it. For [[ethics]] I'm currently reading the fantastic book "The Fundamentals of Ethics" by Russ Shafer Landau. I also highly recommend [[The Righteous Mind]] by Jonathan Haidt. 

Would you kill the fat man is another good one.
