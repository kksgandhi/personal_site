The [[experience machine]] is a common thought experiment against virtual worlds, but aren't video games an experience machine? This isn't even part of the paper, this is just me talking lol

argues that [[virtual worlds]] allow for self-discovery and self-construction

And then there's some media history

Maybe people will plug into the experience machine for short times, as a sort of play, or to learn. Maybe people would plug in without a memory suppressor, merely relying on suspension of disbelief.

Would being a scientist and creating pleasurable but ultimately false "discoveries" be a useful pasttime?
