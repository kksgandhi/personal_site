People often call something art if it exemplifies their values.

Some groups value personal expression, and call something art if the artist's personal story is somehow reflected in art (e.g. *Unfinished Painting* or *Feel it Motherfuckers* as expressions of pain in the AIDS epidemic)

Some groups value transgression, and call something art if it spits in the face of tradition and the elites (e.g. *Urinal*)

Some values technical skill, and art is mastery of skill (e.g. *David*)

Some value metaphor and symbolism (*King Charles III* by Jonathan Yeo)

There have been cultures like the Nazis that value strength and liked strong sculptures

American conservatives who value an idyllic past like Kincaid's work

I think this is interesting since it explains why people don't like calling certain things art. They're making a statement of their values. Many artists like honing their craft, and don't like AI art because it de-values honing one's craft.
