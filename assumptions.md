I got this from [[Becoming A Critically Reflective Teacher-Stephen]] but honestly idk how helpful it is.

 - paradigmatic assumptions
   - used to order the world into fundamental categories
 - prescriptive assumptions
   - what ought to happen in a certain case
   - this "should" be the case, you "should" do this.
 - causal assumptions
   - assumptions about how the world works, and what can be changed
