[interface comparison](interface%20comparison.md) of jigsaw puzzles in physical, tangible, and graphical space

*tangible interfaces* help kids learn I guess, but damn are they hard to implement in the classroom

[SDT](SDT.md) \[26]

uses the [intrinsic motivation inventory](intrinsic%20motivation%20inventory.md)

studies using [children as participants](children%20as%20participants.md) might actually be better if you measure laughter and yawns, rather than answers to questions

between subjects study with three interface styles and puzzle themes

**IMPORTANT** The tangible interface was literally just the traditional interface with #gamification elements atop, such as sounds and colors when pieces were connected.

used the [IMI](IMI.md) and [smileyometer](smileyometer.md)

participants collaborated somewhat, with a lot of being absorbed in their activity, often by splitting work, especially when participants had an age difference. Easier to collaborate with PUI and TUI (physical and tangible) since there's enough space to move around

children had trouble with the mouse

children were more engaged by TUI and PUI
