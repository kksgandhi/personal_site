If there's an online community for something you are interested in, you can easily join it and leave. That ease is very good, but it means that many of the aspects of what makes a strong community (namely length of time, trust, etc.) can't exist. Thus people overrely on [[gatekeeping]] to ensure their communities keep out undesirables. (Whether that's a good thing or not depends on context.)
