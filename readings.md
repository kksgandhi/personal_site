 - Another reference that I use a lot is [K. R. Koedinger, J. L. Booth, and D. Klahr, “Instructional Complexity and the Science to Constrain It,” Science (80-. )., vol. 342, no. 6161, pp. 935–937, Nov. 2013, doi: 10.1126/science.1238056.]. The paper itself is not super useful (though it's a great reference for motivating grants) but the table of instructional design principles is great and if you look at the table provided in the supplementary material you can find the original sources for that principle list. What you're most interested in likely lives in the Sense-making / Understanding space. I've also used this list as this basis for a reference deck of principle cards that I use in my class here: http://edugames.design/principles I need to make some updates but might be useful for thinking about design.
