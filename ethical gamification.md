Gamification can become addicting, in a negative way. Sam Liberty argues that games ought to be:

 - Empowering (give players options)
 - Transparent (upfront about their pricing model)
 - Holistic (To the extent possible, all game experiences are in one purchase)
 - Intrinsically motivating (don't abuse extrinsic motivators to get people coming back)
 - Customizable (accessible and modifiable)
