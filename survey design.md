When designing a survey (also known as a scale or measure) you want it to be [[test validity|valid]]. It's better to use an existing survey if possible since those have been validated.

Many community scales specifically relate to structured communities one is already part of (neighborhoods, MMORPG groups, companies), rather than the inclusiveness of new communities
