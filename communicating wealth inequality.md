 - [[Changing The Narrative On Wealth Inequality]] is an **incredible** resource.
 - [This paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691610393524) finds that people massively underestimate wealth inequality, and that even Republicans want a significantly more equal society than we currently have.
   - other articles on how to communicate wealth inequality (e.g. [A](https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2024/feb/us-wealth-inequality-widespread-gains-gaps-remain) and [B](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/02/07/6-facts-about-economic-inequality-in-the-u-s/) use pretty straightforward datavis techniques.)
 - [This tool](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-4324-6_4#Sec77) for wealth management was interesting, but I didn't see anything relevant.

   - People vastly underestimate wealth inequality, and when they understand it, they call for redistribution
