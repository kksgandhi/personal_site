exurb1a is an incredible youtuber and it is not an exaggeration to say that some of his videos are some of the best I've ever seen.

That said, there is some evidence that he is a horrible person. (As in, I'm omitting some of the accusations against him because content warnings). [Here is a video on the topic](https://youtu.be/CqIujvFf1rs), however since I'm not familiar with the author, I can't say how accurate it is.

This is always a difficult discussion to have since I'm obviously not qualified to analyze the case myself, and am caught between not wanting to support a horrible person, while also not wanting to "cancel" someone off of accusations. I've personally decided to watch exurb1a's videos by downloading them so that it does not provide him ad revenue, at least until he releases a statement or more evidence comes to light.

It's particularly sad to me because his "You probably don't exist" video forms a large basis of my views on consciousness and I still reference its ideas when I discuss the topic

This was my note before I was aware of all these controversies:

A bit crude and informal, but some of the best work on happiness and meaning. I suggest "You probably don't exist" and "Meaning is a jumper you have to knit yourself" since their other videos are more poetry than relaxing videos.
