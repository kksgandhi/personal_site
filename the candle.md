A man meets a lunatic, who asks him to wade across a freezing lake while carrying a candle. For complex reasons, the lunatic cannot do it himself, but assures the man that it is of utmost importance. Years later, the lunatic having long since died, the man arrives at the lake and attempts to cross, but the candle goes out halfway through. He goes back to the shore, relights the candle, and tries again. And again. And again, before finally making it.

What do we think of this man? Why did he cross with the candle? He could have just as easily lied, or ignored the task altogether. 

While it seems clear that this man was insane, we do things for equally silly reasons. There are people who climb mount everest for no reward. People who quietly do hobbies for themselves without the intent of telling others, or do things solely to tell others. Some do things because others have told them to, or just to spite others.

Why do we say some things are done for valid reasons, and why do we lampoon the candle carrying man for being insane? What's the difference between us and him?
