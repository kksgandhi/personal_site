Companion project to [[cartoscope]]

 - TOSAR was built to see how discussion would be beneficial in AR based games
 - it is developed using [[Unity]] and [[Vuforia]]
 - Customizable rulesets means that people can come up with many games

AR can be costly, non-portable, and / or require programming. Tileoscope avoids these problems by being general purpose

By playing, participants help with [[image labeling]] in [[citizen science]]
