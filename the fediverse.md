I'm really excited about the future of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), a social media site similar to Twitter. It's free, easy to use, and for most people, this note could just end here. I do want to spend just a bit more time though, explaining why it's different from the last wave of social media sites:

Mastodon is decentralized. It's not controlled by a single company, instead it's made of millions of pieces, all of which communicate with each other seamlessly. Elon Musk could never buy Mastodon and break it, because you could just move "across" Mastodon, keeping all your followers and posts. Mastodon is so decentralized, that it can even connect with other social media sites, with support in the works for Instagram's Threads, Wordpress, and Tumblr. I'm simplifying a bunch, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/S57uhCQBEk0?si=QFosLoW4AJrVAITR) for a slightly more technical explanation.

Obviously Mastodon isn't perfect, it's smaller than most social media, plus the software isn't as refined, but I've been really enjoying it and it's definitely worth checking out!
