 - [[social development theory]]
 - [[zone of proximal development]]
 - [[cognitive apprenticeship]]
 - [[problem based learning]]

Apparently Kolb's experiential learning cycle describes learning goals (ala Bloom's taxonomy), but with a constructivist angle

Jargon and Notes
----------------

 - constructionism is similar to constructivism, but focuses on building something tangible that's also personally meaningful. (Doroudi)
 - Assimilation is when new information is incorporated into "schemes" (knowledge structures). (Doroudi)
 - Accommodation is when those schemes themselves are changed in reaction to new information. (Doroudi)
