Everyone is a bit of a hypocrite. I fully believe that $20 would create more happiness for a poor person than for me, and that maximizing happiness is correct ethically, yet I do not donate most of my money.

Republicans are for small government, but have many authoritarian tendencies.

I recently saw a meme which was along the lines of: Democrats claim they care about the lives of children, yet they allow millions of [[abortion|abortions]] to happen!

I saw another meme: Republicans claim they care about the lives of fetuses, yet once they're born, they'll happily sell guns to school shooters!
