I recently saw a meme which was along the lines of: Democrats claim they care about the lives of children, yet they allow millions of [[abortion|abortions]] to happen!

I saw another meme: Republicans claim they care about the lives of fetuses, yet once they're born, they'll happily sell guns to school shooters!

Both groups think the other are hypocrites, but that just stems from [[lenses|misunderstanding how each other think]].
