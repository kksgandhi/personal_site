[[games provide a space for values discourse]]

families make available certain types of media, but also make decisions on when to use / how to interpret that media. For example, the Wii is a family console, placed in the nice living room television. Other consoles may not be.

When developing a game, think about:

 - target audience
 - platform choice (where will they play)
 - game format
 - reward structure
 - game mechanics
