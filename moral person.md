From [[Moral And Character Education-Berkowitz]]:

To define [[moral competency]] we have to define "the moral person"

They have a [[moral self system]]

Head, heart, and hand model (which reminds me of [[moral competency - Lapsley & Narvaez]]):

 - [[moral cognition]]
 - [[moral affect]]
 - [[moral behavior]]
