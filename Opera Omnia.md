I don't know whether to recommend Opera Omnia. On the one hand, it was incredibly thought provoking with wonderfully intense themes. On the other hand, it was difficult to play and didn't teach its mechanics well. On yet another hand, the spartan "tutorial" was likely intentional. The way you played was intertwined with the story, and on a few moments my realizations of "how the game works" helped me realize subtleties to the story that were hidden between the lines. 

The game only takes two or so hours to play, so I recommend that you go for it, and if not, [[Opera Omnia discussion - spoilers|here are my thoughts with spoilers]]
