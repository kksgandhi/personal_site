[[edugames don't fit well into the classroom structure]] and so teachers are loathe to completely revamp their curriculum to support an [[educational games|edugame]] study. This means that proper studies on edugames are hard to find.

Furthermore, it's entirely plausible that games have a variety of secondary benefits (such as [[games research needs longitudinal studies|longitudinal retention]]) that edugame studies can't capture as well.

Finally, [[transformational games need thoughtful implementation]] which is difficult for low budget games researchers to do. (And it's hard to quantify as an experimental variable. How do you say "oh this game was poorly made" in a paper?)
