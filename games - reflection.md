Schön's reflection in action and reflection on action is usually cited, but Mezirow's critical self reflection is also used. See critical self reflection in [[Self Reflection Through Roleplay In Chimeria Grayscale-Ortiz]], they have a definition by Dewey though imo it's wordy and unhelpful.

Steps of perspective transformation according to Mezirow:

 - Disorienting Dilemma
 - Self Examination
 - [[critical thinking|critical assessment of assumptions]]
 - Recognition that discontentment and the process of transformation is shared
 - Exploration of new roles, relationships, and actions
 - Planning a course of action
 - Acquiring skills
 - Trying new roles
 - Building [[competence]] and self-confidence in new roles and relationships
 - Reintegration into one's life

These steps don't necessarily happen in order
