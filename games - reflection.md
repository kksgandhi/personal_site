How can we design games to encourage reflection? According to [[Reflection Through Representations Of Personal Data-Karyda|this paper]] reflective pieces are best done through personalized design, but if you're making mass media, you won't know your players nor could you design something personal for them even if you did.

Potential solutions:

 - Design something beautiful that may or may not resonate with certain players and hope that it does.
 - Try to create a player profile and encourage reflection based on that profile.
 - Reflect on things that happened within the game. See [[Overwatch]]'s play of the game system.

Sch√∂n's reflection in action and reflection on action is usually cited, but Mezirow's critical self reflection is also used. See critical self reflection in [[Self Reflection Through Roleplay In Chimeria Grayscale-Ortiz]], they have a definition by Dewey though imo it's wordy and unhelpful.

Steps of perspective transformation according to Mezirow:

 - Disorienting Dilemma
 - Self Examination
 - [[critical thinking|critical assessment of assumptions]]
 - Recognition that discontentment and the process of transformation is shared
 - Exploration of new roles, relationships, and actions
 - Planning a course of action
 - Acquiring skills
 - Trying new roles
 - Building [[competence]] and self-confidence in new roles and relationships
 - Reintegration into one's life

These steps don't necessarily happen in order
