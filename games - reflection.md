How can we design games to encourage reflection? According to [[Reflection Through Representations Of Personal Data-Karyda|this paper]] reflective pieces are best done through personalized design, but if you're making mass media, you won't know your players nor could you design something personal for them even if you did.

Potential solutions:

 - Design something beautiful that may or may not resonate with certain players and hope that it does.
 - Try to create a player profile and encourage reflection based on that profile.
 - Reflect on things that happened within the game. See [[Overwatch]]'s play of the game system.
