This is a [[scholarship]] that you can apply to within 12 months of starting graduate studies.

Apply at the beginning of your second year, deadline is at the end of October.

In the first year, you don't necessarily need a cool project, you just need to talk about how you are going to be a great researcher. Might be easier to get into the GRFP in the first year since second year you'll be competing against other first years.

The GRFP is essentially about funding you, not the proposed project, though the proposed project shows that you understand the field somewhat.

GRFP gives 3 years of funding I can use anytime.

I can apply to the [[GRIP]] or the [[GROW]] after getting into the GRFP.
