A large part of the reason I wrote this note is because of how excited I am about Framework laptops.

[Framework](https://frame.work/) makes super modular laptops, allowing for easy upgrade and repairs. My old laptop has a bunch of stuff that's slightly broken. The only sensible thing was to buy an entirely new laptop, but with a framework, I can easily clean it out, upgrade the slow parts, and fix / replace the broken parts.

There are caveats. It's a medium quality / power laptop for a higher price tag. That said, the price comparison makes much more sense when you think about the framework as a machine you'll use for a decade, maybe more, as opposed to most laptops which grow old and slow after a few years.

The mobile space has a similar company called [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/en/), but they're unfortunately only available in Europe. The [HMD Skyline](https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/hmd-skyline/) is also worth looking out for.
