If I claim that gravity acts by the formula g(MM)/r^2, someone can create an experiment that proves me wrong.

If I claim that God created the universe, it's impossible to create an experiment that proves me wrong. We can argue about it, but no one can prove me wrong in the traditional sense.

If something is falsifiable, then someone can prove it wrong. Barring [cartesian demons](cartesian%20demons.md) of course.
