Things to worry about

 - different screen / browser sizes
   - responsive layouts, flexboxes, css grids. Bootstrap handles all of this
 - different browsers entirely
   - browser compatibility, aka ES6 vs ES5 and whether some js commands will work with older browsers
 - disability access
   - media queries
 - the back button
 - test against common plugins
