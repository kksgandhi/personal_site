On paper, communication seems easy. Something bothering you? Tell whoever is relevant. Boom. Done. So what are the barriers to communication in day to day life?

The obvious answer is [[anxiety]].

 - I'm afraid people might dislike me if I complain too much
 - Or they might take my words in the wrong way
 - Or I'm not close enough to them to say this
 - Or I might accidentally say something inappropriate

But there are deeper reasons as well, [[communication requires knowing yourself]]

Also, [[communication is a two way street]]
