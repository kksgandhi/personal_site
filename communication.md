On paper, communication seems easy. Something bothering you? Tell whoever is relevant. Boom. Done. So what are the barriers to communication in day to day life?

The obvious answer is [[anxiety]].

 - I'm afraid people might dislike me if I complain too much
 - Or they might take my words in the wrong way
 - Or I'm not close enough to them to say this
 - Or I might accidentally say something inappropriate

A slightly more subtle idea is that, in order to communicate, *you need to know yourself*. If you don't know why you feel angry, you will fail to communicate reasonably, and might [[lashing out|lash out]] instead. Communication is thought of as an external thing between people, but funnily enough I think that **one of the best ways to improve your communication is reflecting on yourself**.

Of course there are external things you can do. [[everyone socializes differently|Understanding other people's communication styles is important]]. It's easy to fall into the trap of saying "I've communicated well" when in reality you've communicated well with your style, and the other person doesn't understand what your concerns actually are.
