Games designed to transform the player by making them learn something, [[lenses|see things in a different way]], feel some emotion, etc. Transformational games may also seek to transform the world beyond the player, e.g. through data collection in [[citizen science]].

Transformational games are an umbrella term for [[serious games]], [[educational games]], [[gwap|Games with a purpose]], [[explorables]], etc.
