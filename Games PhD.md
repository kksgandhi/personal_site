Check out my note on [[game conferences]].

Games PhDs fall into a few different categories:

 - Design work (what I do). How can we design games to be more engaging and effective. Mixed methods, including building and playtesting games, user interviews, or large scale online experiments.
 - Technical work. How can we create algorithms or software that make games faster, easier to create, or otherwise push technical boundaries.
 - Games and society. Looks at the culture of people who play games. For example, community forums for a certain game or esports.
 - Games as Art. Critique of games from a literary or philosophical standpoint.
