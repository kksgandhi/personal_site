 - Use the simplest tool possible for a task
   - Complex tasks still require complex tools



The problem with complex tools is lock-in. Google Docs is an awesome, complex tool, but if all your writing is in Google Docs, you almost have to do things "the Google Docs way" after a certain point. Simple tools can be swapped out partially or entirely without too much effort. I think the best example of this are these notes themselves. They're written with vimwiki, viewed with [[Obsidian]], published via Neuron, and managed via a variety of CLI tools like ranger and ag. None of these tools would work if these notes were in Google docs, and each can be swapped out with a similar tool if I like it better.
