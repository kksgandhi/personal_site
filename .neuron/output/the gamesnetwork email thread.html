      Hi all,
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      Although I’m more of a humanities scholar, I’m working with a small interdisciplinary team (me, a psychologist, and a philosopher) using social science methods to study how game players understand decisions and actions in games that appear to have moral and ethical dimensions. We are interested in how players framing their gameplay impacts their moral reasoning.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      I’m wondering if people have suggestions for published research I could read that specifically looks at how interpretation and the gaming situation impacts shapes players’ experience of moral and ethical gameplay. I’ve seen social scientific research applying theories like Moral Foundations Theory and Moral Disengagement Theory (neither of which I’m an expert in) to gameplay. That’s really interesting, but typically, I don’t see that research talking about the ways in which the mediated experience of playing a game differs from everyday life—and that clearly matters. I’m guessing there is social science research on games that does tackle that difference, and I’m just not finding it. If you have suggestions, I’d love to hear it (off list is fine).
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      Also, if anyone would be interested in doing a panel or workshop proposal for the DiGRA 2023 conference on something related to this, I’d be interested in talking about that.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      Thanks!

      Hi,
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      I looked at some of this in my earlier research that ended up turning into World of Warcraft expertise… but my earliest foray into WoW was about how different it was from models of social dilemmas. If you’re interested, there’s a paper I wrote in eLearning, Moral Ambiguity in The Witcher (2008, <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2304/elea.2008.5.3.358' class='text-green-600 hover:underline' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2304/elea.2008.5.3.358</a>) and then my first WoW paper discussed how different cooperation was in the game from models of the prisoner’s dilemma (in Knights of the Old Republic), (2009, <a href='https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1555412008325478' class='text-green-600 hover:underline' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1555412008325478</a>).
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      (As a side note, mine and a bunch of others’ work was recently featured in a Folding Ideas video on professionalism of play, and if anyone is interested in the out-of-print book of mine, Leet Noobs, just email me.)
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      These aren’t exactly directly related to what you’re interested in, but I hope that helps. There’s A LOT out there about Bioware games, etc., but I haven’t looked in a while…

Above his head appears a label that changes every time you look at it between “Hoodie-Wearing Games Scholar Thug,” “PT Lecturer at UW Bothell,” and “A very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.” Do you send him a tweet (@mcdanger), check out his website (markdangerchen.net), or respond to this email?

      You could look into the work of Tilo Hartmann, who has published on Moral Disengagement in Video Games. Also Miguel Sicart comes to mind, who has written about moral dilemmas in gaming – not such if this includes user studies though.

      Hi Kevin,
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      I applied Moral Foundations Theory to a study I did for my PhD thesis that you might be interested in - can’t remember if I talked about it in a short publication yet in my thesis I had examples where players reported the differences between their in-game morals and in-life morals. Also somewhere in that thesis I mentioned how game theory economists often misapply game theory experiments to drawing broad conclusions about cultures’ morals - if that’s of any interest please feel free to email me, always happy to have a chat to share what I can and learn about your project and maybe even help with your panel!

      I am one of the researchers on the morality meter paper Dan cites below (thanks Dan!). We’re about to publish a quantitative exploration of this topic, showing how morality meters can affect players’ in-game choices. I’d be happy to send you a preprint.

    <p class='mb-3'>
      I am a post doctoral gaming/psychology scholar at the University of Luxembourg and finished my PhD on “Moral decision-making in games” this year. With regard to gaming/context variables, I especially looked at time pressure and both avatar and NPCs design and how these three factors influences in-game decision-making.
