invisible labor is work that is mental and [[stochastic labor|stochastic]], and therefore not as recognized as other kinds of labor.

This includes [[stochastic labor]], [[emotional labor]], [[affective labor]], and [[care work]]

### Giving a friend therapy

I think this one is rather self explanatory

### Hiding your true emotions

Smiling when you want to cry, or being [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] to someone who you hate.

### Managing a household

I'm not talking about the physical act of chores, but rather the mental effort of remembering what needs to be done and when, what needs to be purchased from the store, how to do things to avoid complications later on.

### Organizing an event

Similar to managing a household, but with the additional fact that organizing an event requires burning [[social capital]]. You have to put yourself out there, [[leadership frustrations|be on the hook if things don't go as planned]], and bother people to encourage them to come to the event.

### Just generally dealing with people

If someone does something you don't like, you have to worry about whether you talk to them about it, how they'll react, how you should bring it up, and how much [[social capital]] you will burn. Sometimes it feels easier to just handle it yourself, but over time this can lead to resentment if there isn't [[communication]].
