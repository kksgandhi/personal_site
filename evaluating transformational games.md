Notes from [[Transformational_Framework-Culyba]]:

Levels of evaluation

 - It seems reasonable
 - Prior research shows it'll probably work
 - Experts say it will work
 - Anecdotal data
 - Formally researched

How to evaluate:

 - Track player actions in game
 - Track player actions irl
 - Survey players about their intentions
 - Survey stakeholders surrounding the players
 - Test the player

Think about intermediaries: If you can't evaluate the thing you want, what can substitute?

Imagine you already have the data, have done the analysis, and made the visualizations. What does it look like? What steps do you need to get that data?

Try to evaluate with the audience and context you would actually deploy in.

Players may themselves be interested in assessments, implicit or explicit
