About research creation, which I have in my notes as [[research through design]]. In the US it's called "arts based research"

research creation flies in the face of a lot of traditional research structure.

Some journals are picking it up: Vectors, Qualitative Inquiry, and the Canadian Journal of Communication

The traditional structures of academia limit these newer approaches

Talks a bit about how Canada supports research creation

Haseman 2006 argues that the following markers indicate credibility in research creation:

 - There is a clearly established problem that drives the study, usually made clear through a "research question" or "enthusiasm of practice"
 - The process of research is scrutinized, with publicly articulated methodology 
 - the research is undertaken within its field of inquiry?? (don't really get what that means)
 - the knowledge is reported to others with a demonstrable benefit. 
 - what becomes known is made available for peer review.

Though Chapman and Sawchuck feel like Haseman is still trying to fit research creation to a more traditional research mold too much

Quantitative research > Qualitative research > ethnography (in terms of metricability)

This paper aims to legitimatize research creation as something distinct (though it is still traditional in that it follows a variety of traditions). Leavy 2009, Barrett and Bolt 2010, and Haseman 2006 talk about research creation in the context of established metrics. That approach is strategically useful for getting your research approved, but is still ultimately limiting to research creation.

Research creation is not a thing, but a family of things

Research for creation
---------------------

The prepwork for research creation. Feels weird to make it a subsection, but whatever

Research from creation
----------------------

We don't just have to build a product and evaluate it, the process itself can create user-responses that teach us.

Creative presentations of research
----------------------------------

The academic, text focused structure is overly limiting.

Creation as research
--------------------

Whereas research from creation involves a cycle of creation and reflection, creation as research weaves the creation itself as the knowledge produced, blurring the boundaries between artifact and research.
