Power fantasy in games often refers to a sort of strength power fantasy: the ability for player characters in games to do things their players couldn't do because those actions are impossible or immoral. While not usually talked about, I think there are other kinds of power fantasy:

 - [[intellectual power fantasy]]
 - [[the kindness power fantasy]]
