I am obsessed with this idea: It's extremely easy for people to figure out that *something* is wrong with their life, it's extremely difficult to figure out *what* that something is.

Sometimes its simple and inconsequential. Someone is angry at their friends because they are hungry. Sometimes its far more intense, like someone getting angry at their significant other because they feel the relationship is falling apart, but don't fully understand what the friction comes from.

It's easy for people to exploit this. "Do you feel miserable? It's probably because you're unattractive. Buy our makeup!". "Is your town falling apart? Blame immigrants instead of trying to fix these problems."
