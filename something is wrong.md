I am obsessed with how easy it is for people to figure out that *something* is wrong with their lives, while it's extremely difficult to figure out *what* that something is.

Sometimes its simple and inconsequential — someone is angry at their friends because they are hungry. Sometimes its more intense — someone getting angry at their significant other because they feel the relationship is falling apart, but don't fully understand what the friction comes from.

It's easy for people to exploit this. "Do you feel miserable? It's probably because you're unattractive. Buy our makeup!". "Is your town falling apart? Blame immigrants instead of trying to fix these problems."
