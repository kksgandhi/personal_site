Reaching out to teachers for classroom integration:

 - Survey syllabi, identify content pieces and the process they use
 - What are the course learning outcomes?
 - Identify pain points and build something that addresses those pain points specifically.
 - Maybe make a focus group with a few teachers?

Market it as a way for teachers to "take a day off" by putting your activity on instead

Ok some old notes about classroom integration:

Starting a game from scratch is probably a bad idea tbh. Working with a professor / modding a game is a good idea.

Teachers are using fragmented and disparate technologies from the pandemic. How can those be tied together? Especially with computers that may not be able to access anything other than canvas (locked down work computers, etc.)

Could the games that are built be group experiences? Where discussion and reflection is facilitated by the game?
