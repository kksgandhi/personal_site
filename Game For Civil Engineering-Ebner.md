has some good related work on animations and explorables.

advanced explorable for teaching advanced students, focused on physics and forces

students liked it, though the authors claimed their game needed to be more motivating, since all the students (control and game condition) lost motivation because of the tough subject matter.

has some interesting stuff about incidental learning, learning that isn't the goal, but happens anyways.
