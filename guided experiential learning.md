Lesson plans should have

 - Objectives
 - Reasons for learning
 - Overview
 - Conceptual Knowledge
 - Demonstration of the Procedure
 - Part and whole-task practice with corrective feedback
 - Challenging, competency based tests that include reactions and learning performance.

[[Failure Of Discovery Based Learning And Benefits Of Guided Training Methods-Clark]] has a section on using [[GEL]] when applying [[cognitive task analysis]] on [[subject matter experts]]

To promote skill transfer to novel environments, DeCorte and Merill recommend

 - Environment
   - Learn in an environment that reflects the environment where the skill will actually be applied
 - Motivation
   - Link GEL to tangible and personally relevant benefits and risks associated with each task to be learned.
 - Increasing Novelty
   - increasingly novel and challenging scenarios for use in practice exercises and assessments.
 - Variable Practice
   - Part task practice (during lessons) and whole task practice
 - Targeted Feedback

GEL to promote flexible expertise:

 - analogies to prior knowledge
 - open questions during feedback (ask students about their reasoning and problem solving strategies, allow them to explore alternatives rather than being told the correct path)
