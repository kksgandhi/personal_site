[Football 17776](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football), a beautiful story about immortality, humanity, and well, technically football. But not really

# Incoherent and spoiler filled ramblings beneath this line

You have [[immortality]]. Now what? It's easy to imagine [[Sisyphus]] happy when you know things have an end. But what about true immortality?

Then you play football.

You play football with silly rules. You play football and run into tornados. You "fight" over a patch of land for 13 thousand years. [[the absurd]] has nothing on this. Everything is arbitrary, and social, and stupid, and beautiful

[[the human story|"I wonder if there's a single place in the whole world that's never had a story". There isn't.]]

People didn't build because they didn't want a perfect life. They wanted to want. Unsure of how I feel about that.

And since no one new was born, there was no new generation who wanted progress.

explore? Or cherish what you have?

there's just so much hope.
