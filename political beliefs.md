If you have a political belief, is it:

 - something that would work in a perfect world, but you know wouldn't work in this one.
 - something you believe roughly, but aren't fully confident in.
 - something you believe for yourself, but wouldn't enforce upon others
 - something you believe, but can't enforce
 - something you believe, but can't enforce without side effects you feel uncomfortable with (like a surveillance state)
 - something you believe in and would enforce.
