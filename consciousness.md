We can make predictions about the world around us. If I throw a ball, I can predict where it's going to land. This is known as "having a model" of the world, and its useful to have.

Similarly, it's useful to have a model of other people. If I say "you look beautiful", it's good to be able to predict how someone will react.

Finally, we have a model of ourselves. I know not to order certain food at a restaurant because I know I won't like it.

Consciousness is having a model of yourself, and something is more / less conscious depending on how strong its model is of itself.

[[consciousness is just a narrative]]
