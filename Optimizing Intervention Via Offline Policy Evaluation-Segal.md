Their previous work here: [[Intervention_Strategies_For_Engagement-Segal_Gal]]

They used an ML model to predict disengagement, then threw a random message at players. It's not fully clear yet what the difference is here, but this one appears to optimize across message types and its reward function optimizes for longer term effects.

So my shitty understanding of this paper is that their second model used data from random interventions to learn what kind of interventions were best
