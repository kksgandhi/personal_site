Being happy is a good thing, something so many people strive for, but if someone was happy no matter what, they wouldn't get anything done. They might sit around, lose their job, etc.

Pushing yourself to be productive is anathema to being content, though it should be noted that productivity can lead to happiness later. (Making a bunch of money now can lead to a carefree retirement)
