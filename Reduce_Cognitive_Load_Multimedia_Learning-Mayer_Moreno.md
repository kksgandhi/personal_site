[[dual channel theory]]

[[limited capacity assumption]]

essential processing: main processing of the material

incidental processing: processing of supplementary items, such as music or color

representational holding: Holding items in short term memory because not everything can be shown at once

 - Split essential learning between two channels, don't force someone to read something and look at an image at the same time
 - Segment learning
 - [[learning - pretrain|pretrain]]: It's similar to segmenting, but essentially you give them base information about terms and such before hitting them with the essential information
 - don't mix essential and incidental processing in the same channel
 - make words and pictures near each other
 - eliminate redundancy (such as narrative and onscreen text) (don't know how much I agree with this one.)
 - synchronize things to prevent representational holding
   - Or look for people who are good at representational holding (aka people with good mental image skills)
