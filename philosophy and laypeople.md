So these are my experiences and opinions:

My hours of thinking about ethics don't actually make me a nicer person, don't affect how I do things day to day. But just because I don't think about utilitarianism when I brew my coffee, doesn't mean that it doesn't inform my positions. Moral philosophy (as an example) affects how I view my abstract duties towards other people. This in turn affects how I think about the people I actually interact with, which finally affects my actual day to day interactions.

In addition, thinking about philosophy trains my brain to think in [[abstractions]], and makes me used to the idea of challenging my own beliefs. While I absolutely have my flaws, there are a great many people who are not used to this style of thinking, and become stuck in their ways, [[something is wrong|unable to understand why they are lashing out or sticking so strongly to the ideas that they hold dear]].

I mean I'm still a dumbass, but philosophy helps a little bit.

So back to the original question of why the average person should learn philosophy, I think that everyone would gain some benefit from thinking in the ways I mentioned above. I absolutely don't think everyone needs formal schooling for years on end, but even some basic stuff would improve many people's lives.
