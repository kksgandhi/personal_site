I really like thinking about productivity. I probably like it too much, and spend more time figuring out ways to be productive, rather than actually *being productive*. (i.e. the [[productivity paradox]])

If a task is complex, I use a complex tool, but generally, I want to use the simplest tool available for any given task. The problem with complex tools is lock-in. Google Docs is an awesome, complex tool, but if all your writing is in Google Docs, you almost have to do things "the Google Docs way" after a certain point. Simple tools can be swapped out partially or entirely without too much effort. I think the best example of this are these notes themselves. They're written with vimwiki, viewed with [[Obsidian]], published via Neuron, and managed via a variety of CLI tools like ranger and ag, which wouldn't really work if they were all in google docs or evernote or something.
