I really like thinking about productivity. I probably like it too much, and spend more time figuring out ways to be productive, rather than actually *being productive*. (i.e. the [[productivity paradox]])

[[use the simplest tool possible]]

 - [[productivity - tools]]
 - [[productivity - methods]]
 - [[other productivity ideas]]
