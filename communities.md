I'm not a sociologist, anthropologist, or historian, and this note is going to bastardize all of those fields.

Humans evolved to live in tight knit communities where most everyone knew each other and worked together. Hyper industrialization has [[communities are compartmentalized|compartmentalized]] the ways in which we live and [[human worth|over-applied metrics to assigning value to us]]. This is an explanation for the rise of loneliness, [[alienation from work]], social media, internet communities, and [[parasocial relationships]]. While this is, of course, a massive oversimplification, I hope that it's an interesting thought with an element of truth.

Since [[communities are so transient]], they resort to increasingly [[aggressive tactics]] to retain the [[benefits of community]].
