I'm not a sociologist, anthropologist, or historian, and this note is going to bastardize all of those fields.

Humans evolved to live in tight knit communities where most everyone knew each other and worked together. [[mobility has changed communities|Hyper industrialization]] has [[communities are compartmentalized|compartmentalized]] the ways in which we live and [[human worth|over-applied metrics to assigning value to us]]. This is an explanation for the rise of loneliness, [[alienation from work]]#, social media, internet communities, and [[parasocial relationships]]. While this is, of course, a massive oversimplification, I hope that it's an interesting thought with an element of truth.

Since [[communities are increasingly transient|communities are so transient]], they resort to increasingly [[gatekeeping|aggressive tactics]] to retain the [[benefits of community]].
