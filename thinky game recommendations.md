### Tactical Breach Wizards (25 hours)

Incredibly funny, but also serious when it needs to be. Interesting strategic depth as well!

My rating: 8/10\
Mass Appeal: 5/10

### Patrick's Parabox (10 hours)

Clever and "no-fluff" puzzles. The game has a really well designed learning curve and the puzzles are all bite sized, so you move between them quickly.

My rating: 9/10
Mass Appeal: 6/10

### Tunic (24 hours)

Secrets on Secrets on Secrets on Secrets. This game is beautiful, makes you feel like a genius, and has some mind blowing puzzles. Some of the combat is tough, I recommend lowering the difficulty, and some of the late game puzzles are insanely tough (i.e. you could spend hours on some individual puzzles alone), so I recommend giving them a solid attempt, then looking up solutions.

My rating 7/10\
Mass appeal 7/10
