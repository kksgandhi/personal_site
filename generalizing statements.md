Do Muslims commit terrorism? Do republicans sabotage public education? Do companies encourage consumerism?

When you say things like that, what do you mean? That most members of the group actively do what you're saying? That only some of them do? That they're associated with the action? Benefit from it? Create a culture where it's common?

Saying "X group does Y" is a weasel statement, it allows you to not fully form your argument, instead relying on the listener to interpret it as they like and ignore any weeds they might have caught if you had been more explicit. Of course listeners will find fewer flaws with an argument they interpreted themselves.

This kind of weaseling reminds me a bit of [[system anthropomorphization]].
