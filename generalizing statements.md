*politics*

Many political statements are of the form: X group causes Y

* Teachers create an environment for students to learn
* Muslims commit terrorism
* Capitalists encourage consumerism as an opioid for the horrors of
  capitalism

These statements are all structured the same way, but are vastly
different in meaning. Potential meanings:

* Most members of group X actively do Y
* Some members of group X actively do Y
* Members of group X are associated with Y
* Members of group X benefit from Y
* Members of group X create a culture where Y is common

Saying "X group does Y" is a weasel statement, it allows you to not fully form your
argument, instead relying on the listener to interpret it as they like
and ignore any weeds they might have caught if you had been more
explicit. Of course listeners will find fewer flaws with an argument
they interpreted themselves.
