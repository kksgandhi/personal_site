[[what makes a game philosophical]]? Also, may as well link my list of [[philosophy - games]]

Games that are designed to invite players to think philosophically within (and about) their gameworlds.

Not only do they have philosophy central to their plots, but they leverage [[moral dilemmas|hypotheticals]] to [[ethics involves the juxtaposition between intuition and reason|stimulate our intuitions]] and [[irritation triggers reflection|trigger our critical faculties]].

This paper is not looking at games that refer to philosophers or provide simple accounts of philosophy history.

[[what is philosophy]]?

 - [[interaction|interactivity]] allows players to take meaningful action, responsibility, and critically reflect.
 - [[replayability allows for exploration]]
 - [[game worlds are more detailed than other media]]

Focused, shorter games with specific messages could be also thought of as "playable essays" or "playable thought experiments"

Common areas currently addressed by philosophical games

 - ethics and morality
   - [[moral dilemmas]] in games
 - political dissent & social criticism
   - [[list of civics games]]
 - alterity and estrangement
   - games that just do something weird or provide [[perspective taking]]
 - our understanding of games
   - [[The Stanley Parable]] discusses free will and limitation in games, [[The Beginner's Guide]] talks about what it even means to make games. 

Criticism and Discussion
------------------------

Critiques and thoughts about the paper, since the one I'm currently looking at is a rough draft:

 - The article ramps up rather rapidly in its reading level, e.g. the statement "Philosophers of fiction understand 'fictionality' as a quality of representational content" could scare readers away. That said, I think this is at an appropriate level if the intended audience is primarily game academics.
 - I think the list of common areas addressed by philosophical games is incomplete, though what deserves placement on the list is of course, subjective. That said, I do think [[consciousness]] + the [[self]] (especially [[AI consciousness]]) could make a nice addition. Games like [[The Talos Principle]], [[SOMA]], [[Detroit - Become Human]], and [[Event0]] are all great examples in this space. My list [[philosophy - games]] has even more category breakdowns.
 - My note on [[what makes a game philosophical]] discusses how some games are "more philosophical" than others, something that could be an interesting section in this paper.
