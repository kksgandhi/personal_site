This session features Detention (2017, 2018), a first person role-playing survival horror game developed and published by Red Candle Games. The game story is inspired by the actual history of Taiwan in the 1960s, when the Taiwanese government suppressed its citizens using martial law during the "White Terror" period. The game protagonists, Wei and Ray, wake up in an empty school and attempt to leave the school, while encountering a series of horrific events.
