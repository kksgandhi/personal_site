I was tired today, but I went climbing anyways.

It made me feel weird, I couldn't do the moves I normally do.

But the slightly less expected side effect was that... I felt fear for the first time in a long while.

I often want to get off the wall because my fingers hurt, but today I asked myself "why am I up here? What am I doing? I just want to go home"

I pushed through, had a decent climb

But turns out that fear was appropriate, just for a different reason.

My sweatpants had a giant hole in the crotch.

and I climbed like that for 90 fucking minutes.
