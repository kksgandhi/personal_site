From [[Can Ethics Be Taught-Ryan]]:

Ethics classes should have concrete goals and teach [[ethics as a process]]

 - assist students in the formation of their personal values and moral ideas
 - introduce the broad range of moral problems facing their society
 - provide contact with ethical theories and moral traditions
 - give them the opportunity to wrestle with ethical problems
