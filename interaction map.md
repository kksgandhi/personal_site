Examination of interactions possible with NPCs. Taking note of important dialogue that happens throughout the game?

 - Are interactions limited (is there only one or two responses offered to answer a question)?
 - Do interactions change over time (as Sims get to know one another, and like one another, are more choices for interaction are offered)?
 - What is the range of interaction?
 - Are NPCs present, and what dialogue options are offered to them? Can they be interacted with? How? How variable are their interactions?

How much freedom does the player have in shaping the game's direction?
