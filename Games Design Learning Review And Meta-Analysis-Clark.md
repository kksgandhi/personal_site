digital [games](games.md) and learning for K-16

digital games significantly enhance student learning relative to nongame conditions

3 previous meta analyses. Discusses some things known as moderator variables? I'm unsure of what those are... it talks about how the various meta analyses controlled for things? idk seems specific and not conclusion focused

* Vogel et. al found that games and simulations led to higher cognitive outcomes and attitudinal outcomes than traditional instruction
* Sitzmann et. al found higher self-efficacy, declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, and retention
* Wouters et. al found that serious games were more effective than conventional instruction. Schematic serious games were significantly more effective than cartoon like or realistic games. Serious games showed larger gains compared to mixed instruction rather than when compared to passive instruction.

some stuff about the way they searched in the meta-analysis...

[media comparison](media%20comparison.md) vs [value added comparison](value%20added%20comparison.md)

unlimited access to a game is better. Multiple sessions is better. One session? You might as well just not game

hypothesis: more complex games better

visual stuff

* visual realism
* camera perspective
* anthropomorphism

apparently there's something wrong with the way games studies are done? Didn't fully understand it

p9 is some eligibility criteria...

p10 has some neat stuff on how they actually performed the meta analysis
