Most relevant ones for me:

 - CHIPlay
   - Research into how humans play games
 - DiGRA
   - Cultural and humanities side of games research
 - FDG
   - Mix between humanities and AI/PCG/technical games research, prides itself on being where technical and non-technical people meet.
 - AIIDE
   - AI
 - COG
   - idk what exactly, but seems pretty technical with some other stuff thrown in.
