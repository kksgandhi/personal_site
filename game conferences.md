CHIPlay (see also the "Games and Play" track at CHI): Top conference for games, but is a bit limited in topics. It focuses on how players interact with games, and has a decent split between quantitative and qualitative studies.

FDG: Sells itself as the conference where technical and non-technical people meet. Focuses on automatically generating content in games, creating systems that bolster narratives in games, and design work in general.

DiGRA: Focuses on the artistic and social impacts of games. They look at gaming culture, gaming trends, and have interesting experimental game design.

EXAG: This is a track within the larger AI conference AIIDE. They look at AI in games. (Notably, most AI in games is unlike ChatGPT or LLMs. The Youtube channel "AI in games" has a good breakdown)

COG: Mostly technical conference, but still pretty general. Has an interesting track on "simulations", which includes training simulations for firefighters and roleplay games to teach business students how to run a business.

There are plenty of conferences for educational games specifically, but they tend to be more local and held sporadically. Some of the bigger ones are Serious Play and Games 4 Change (non-academic conferences). For academic conferences, see Meaningful Play, GALA, ECGBL, Games Learning Society, Play Make Learn.

Learning and CS Education conferences:

 - SIGCSE (Late February)
   - Big conference, CS education research. A bit informal. A bit of pure research, a bit of implementation research ("I did something in my class, here's what worked and what didn't!")
 - ASEE (Late June)
   - Similar to SIGCSE, but more broader STEM and even bigger. Easy to get a paper into apparently.
 - ICER
   - International CS education research. Higher quality and smaller venue than SIGCSE
 - I/ITSEC
   - Simulations, VR, and training for health and military applications
