My [[Rice|undergraduate university]] had a program where students could teach classes, so I built a philosophy survey course using games to teach topics rather than textbooks. 

The course was for college credit, and I taught it for 2 semesters, getting reviews that were 40% "good" and 60% "outstanding".

Many of the games I used can be found on [[philosophy - games|my list of philosophical games]].
