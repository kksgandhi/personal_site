There have been recent pushes to study games which enable [[SEL|social and emotional learning]]. [[reflective games|Reflective games]] are well suited to this task. As examples, see [[Spent]] and [[Papers Please]].

[[Reflective Game Design-Khaled|Khaled]] claims that reflection is under-represented within mainstream entertainment games. Perhaps this is because it's hard to balance the conflicting needs of [[commercialism affects art|commercial viability]] and designing for reflection? This paper tackles this issue by analyzing [[player experience|player perceptions]] of reflective games in the specific context of [[mass market games|mass-market oriented games]].

Two major questions:

 - How do games encourage reflection?
 - Which games / [[game elements]] do players count as successful or unsuccessful at being reflective?

Background
----------

 - [[Definition Of Philosophical Game-Gualeni|What is a philosophical games?]]
 - [[The Implied Designer-Van De Mosselaer|The implied designer can be more important than the actual designer.]]
 - [[Fleck and Fitzpatrick's reflection framework|There are different levels of reflection]]. [[games can teach philosophy|Games are good at teaching deeper, abstract concepts]] and facilitating reflection, though [[game transformations are low level|higher levels of reflection are rarer]].
 - Reflection is linked to [[emotional challenge]]. Challenge can actually [[stress allows us to learn|help us learn]].
 - [[Moments That Challenge A Player-Whitby|Whitby's work]] discusses moments in gameplay that players reported as causing them to reflect.
 - All the big stuff is important, but so is the [[ordinary player experience]]
 - Many reflective games fail because they try to [[transformational games need thoughtful implementation|just bluntly put a message on top of a game that has no relation to the message]]
 - One of the big theoretical pieces of work is [[Reflective Game Design-Khaled|Khaled's Reflective Game Design]]. Specifically the idea that [[conventional game design works against reflection]]

Methods
-------

The original research questions dealt with [[philosophy - games|philosophical games]]. As such, the survey asked players about games that tried to "be philosophical", and whether they felt like those games succeeded or failed at that task.

A [[qualitative analysis]] was conducted. Specifically a [[thematic analysis]] with a [[phenomenelogical model|phenomenelogical]] approach

Results & Discussion
--------------------

The paper is categorized by 4 major themes:

 - [[game elements that surround the message, support the message|Game elements that surround the message, support the message]]
 - [[games enable the intellectual exploration of various perspectives|Games enable the intellectual exploration of various perspectives]]
 - [[relating the message to the player increases its power|Relating the message to the player increases its power]]
 - [[respect the player's intelligence with subtle messages, slowly built|Respect the player's intelligence with subtle messages, slowly built]]

[[media - failure|This paper talks about games that failed a lot, but that idea has some subtle nuances worth discussing]]

So finally, [[how to design reflective games|how do we design reflective games?]]

Limitations and future work
---------------------------

 - The definition of mass-market games conflates indie games and AAA games, which probably should be talked about separately
 - The demographics were mostly young Western men. Marginalized communities probably view games differently, especially when it comes to conceptions of identity.
 - Future work could focus on:
   - Different communities
   - case studies of individual games
   - modifying the survey questions, potentially to focus into certain themes
   - conduct thorough interviews rather than broad survey questions
