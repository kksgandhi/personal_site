You can be right, and still be:

 - unreasonable
 - sarcastic
 - [[brutal honesty|rude]]
 - unwilling to compromise
 - missing the larger picture
 - unable to let something go
 - only technically correct
 - [[it is possible to make no mistakes and still lose|lucky, not smart]]

Why are we so obsessed with who was right in an argument?
