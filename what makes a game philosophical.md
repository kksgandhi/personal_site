What puts something in the category of "philosophy game"? This is a tough and honestly subjective distinction

 - There are games that bring up explicit philosophy texts and play with formal concepts ([[The Talos Principle]])
 - There are games that push a philosophy, though don't bring up literature and aren't overly explicit about it ([[The Stanley Parable]])
 - There are games that have quandaries situated in larger, non philosophy oriented game structure ([[Fallout 3]])
 - There are games that convey a feeling and encourage reflection, but don't really have an explicit message ([[Outer Wilds]])
 - And then there are games that just resonate with people (This one is personal preference... [[A Short Hike]] might be a good example?)

Dr. [[Gualeni]] wrote a definition, whose notes are here: [[Definition Of Philosophical Game-Gualeni]]
