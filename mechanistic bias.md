People deny that GPT can understand things, that AI art is actually creative. And honestly, they have good points, I don't think these systems are there yet.

At the same time though, I have to wonder... are people quick to say this, because they are afraid that they are, on some fundamental level, mechanical? That all of emotion, and wonder, and creativity is the result of a cold, unfeeling process?

A worm is such a basic organism that it's basically just following a program. Hell, [we've even mapped out the neurons of a worm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210224143517.htm). A toad is somewhat more complex, but really we could make a robot that acted like a toad (the hard part would be the physics of the tongue, not the intelligence of the creature). A dog is smarter though, and a human smarter still... but where's the line? Where does something go from following a program to creativity?
