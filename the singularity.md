I get a new piece of AI news every day. Every fucking day, my mind is blown by how AI is advancing. AI can understand subtle humor now. It can hide itself, act as an agent. Hire people to do fucking captchas. The thing about exponential curves is that they look flat, until they've blown up beyond comprehension.

[Metaculus](https://aicountdown.com/) (an aggregator of votes by AI experts) predicts weak AGI in 3 years, and strong AGI only a few years after that. 

That's... That's fucking absurd. Like we all go about our lives, because nothing changes day to day, but how can anyone even function in the face of that instability? I sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, believe that in my lifetime, AI will usher us into a [[post scarcity economy]] or [[AI control problem|destroy us all]]. 

Thinking about the singularity has made me [[the death of who we are|just a little bit depressed]].
