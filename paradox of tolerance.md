An inclusive group tolerates everyone, right? If you tolerate everyone, you will tolerate horrible people, who will make the group intolerant.

In other words, if you want to make a strong [[communities|community]], you need to [[gatekeeping|gatekeep]] to an extent.

I've seen this in my own life. As an example, I once invited someone to a group event who hurt someone else. By being *explicitly tolerant* of the person who had done the hurting, I had been *implicitly intolerant* of the person who was hurt. In retrospect, I should have thought more about to what extent I wanted to be inclusive to this person.

Perhaps tolerance is not unilateral acceptance, but a contract: I will accept you, as long as you accept others.
