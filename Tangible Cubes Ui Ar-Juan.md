The team built an *educational game* that allowed children to learn about animals that are at the risk of extinction

The game uses a head mounted display

Neat example of a [comparative study](comparative%20study.md)

children played one game, were given a questionnaire, and then played the second game, then the second game questionnaire, then a final questionnaire
