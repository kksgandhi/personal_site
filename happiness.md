Happiness is unattainable due to the [[hedonic treadmill]]. Despite this, there is no treadmill for meaning ([a nice exurb1a video on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=psaCM1j9LEM\&t\=41)). Finding meaning and fulfillment in your life through [[stoicism]] is infinitely more valuable than chasing happiness, no one can take that away from you.
