A general guide to happiness is impossible, it's so specific to each person. Here are my thoughts, I don't expect it to fix you, but maybe it will help.

There are lower pleasures (a cheeseburger, a nice massage, unexpected money) and there are higher pleasures ([[eudaimonia]], justified pride, [[stability]]). Both are [[lower and higher pleasures are intertwined|intertwined]], but there is a sense in which [[hedonic treadmill|lower pleasures are fleeting]] while higher pleasures can last years or even your entire lifetime. 

I think the key to finding happiness is avoiding [[fragility]], decreasing your reliance on your [[identity]] and [[external validation]]. 

One issue is that it's easy to put in a lot of effort for absolutely nothing. So many people assume that climbing their mountain or finding their white whale will bring them happiness and silence the voices in their head, but it's easy to do that and [[paradox of hedonism|still feel hollow]]. To avoid this trap, [[stoicism]] and [[self reflection]] are useful to understand what you really need. Are you someone who values achievement, or is that just a proxy for other insecurities?

Also, facing [[the absurd]] can't hurt.
