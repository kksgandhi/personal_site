Philosophy said there's chains and a key, but only delivered the first to me.

Philosophy frees us, helps us understand ourselves and the world around us. At the same time, it binds us, teaching us about problems that we may have never known existed.

[[ignorance is bliss]]

I think that learning philosophy is valuable, but sometimes I have to convince myself of that fact. Because of the [[deconstruction]] problem, I sometimes have trouble dealing with concrete, pragmatic problems, because I spiral into philosophical wormholes of "what really exists".

I think that learning philosophy has helped me understand myself better, and made me a better [[stoicism|stoic]], and allowed me to manage my [[emotions]].
