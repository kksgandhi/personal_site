[Philosophy said there's chains and a key, but only delivered the first to me.](http://smbc-comics.com/comic/2014-01-01)

Philosophy is marketed as this extremely highbrow and beautiful thing. People have this assumption that when they study philosophy they'll magically become happy and see the world for what it really is. In my experience though, philosophy shows us a bunch of problems that normal people don't worry about, but is really damn bad at actually helping *solve* anything. If anything, philosophy has actually hindered my ability to think about practical problems that occur in normal conversations, rather than helping me...

I don't know. There are benefits. I think [[stoicism]] has made me a less [[fragility|fragile]] person and it has helped me [[philosophy and laypeople|focus my thought process]].
