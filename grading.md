Read everyone's responses before grading a single one.

When grading grammar, maybe select a section, mark lines with grammar mistakes, but don't tell the students where the mistakes are specifically.

Nilson Chapter 27 has an interesting argument for specifications based grading, where every assignment is pass/fail. (And then you do funky stuff to get a letter grade out of that at the end.)
