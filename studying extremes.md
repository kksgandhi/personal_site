Extreme examples of things rarely show up, but are useful to study to understand more moderate examples.

It's unlikely you will actually meet a [[nazi]] (or at least I hope not), but studying why Nazis believe the things they do can help us understand more "moderate" forms of racism (e.g. the stereotype that welfare queens are POC, or that systematic racism doesn't exist)

Although studying extremes is important, ensure you don't fall into the trap of assuming [[false dichotomies]]
