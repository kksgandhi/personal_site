I think it's unfortunate that "racism" has so many different definitions because, like all problems of [[multidefinitions]], it causes miscommunications. People disagree about certain people / certain laws being racist, and both sides of the disagreement can be "right", but just using different working definitions of racism.

 - [[prejudice]]
 - [[prejudice plus power]]
 - [[racism by proxy]]
 - [[systematic racism]]
