Tag: [[lenses]]

Different ways to look at your game. Each lens lets you focus in on a different part of the [[player experience]] or system, letting you think about your design without being overwhelmed.

I see each lens as a simple question or exercise. E.g. when desiring a level, you can ask yourself: "at each stage, does the player know where they are supposed to go next?". After answering that question, you can ask yourself: "After each intense moment, does the player have a moment to breathe?" etc.

First coined by [[Schell]], I believe.
