[[Conservatives vs Liberals]]
#coherentism

I am a subscriber to /r/conservative (a reddit stream of conservative
news) and am (only technically) a member of Rice's conservative group.
That fact has led me to lose a friend and have many others wonder
incredulously why I would do that.

-   If you have a warrior's fervor in your political opinions, it makes
    sense to know who your enemy is. I've heard so many arguments that
    completely go over the heads of opponents because people don't know
    what their opponents are actually thinking. I'm reasonably confident
    in my ability to make actually convincing points because I know why
    my opponents think they way they do.

-   When I first added /r/conservative to my feed, I found myself in
    disgust at all the stupid and obviously vague headlines. Accusations
    of hypocrisy, incompetence, and corruption that took only an ounce
    of critical thinking to see through. Thing is, while I felt that way
    initially about /r/conservative, I soon started feeling that way
    about my left leaning subreddits as well. What had happened was that
    left leaning BS slipped under my radar easily because it agreed with
    my views while I had a visceral angry reaction to conservative BS of
    the same sort. Over time however, I recognized the patterns
    regardless of political ideology. Seeing the evil tricks used by the
    other side made me more aware of those same tricks used by my own
    side.

-   Much of my confidence in my own views comes from the fact that I've
    seen the strongest possible opposition. The smartest people arguing
    against me, and still I stuck with my views. That's really all I
    have to say. I can't imagine someone simultaneously being confident
    in their ideas while also refusing to hear any opposition or
    criticism.

There are some ideas that are just plain stupid. Not every idea is valid
and deserves attention. That said, not every idea you disagree with is
just plain stupid. Looking at a slew of ideas that make you
uncomfortable makes your own views and self stronger.
