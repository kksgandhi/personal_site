For the longest time, I felt like I had many of the hallmarks of an extrovert, but didn't really fit the category. Like I put on events, was around people a lot, but on the other hand, if nothing was going on, I didn't really feel a compulsion. Like I was happy with myself and such.

I thought that perhaps I wasn't an extrovert, but just someone who has a ton of FOMO, which I still think is accurate to an extent. It's not that I was extroverted, it's more like that I hate to miss out on things. If nothing is going on, nothing to FOMO about. If there are... then shit.

I read this really neat... [article](http://www.plausiblydeniable.com/opinion/gsf.html) that gave me a bit of a different perspective. I think that 1, 4, and 5 apply to me a lot. I don't wanna be ostracized, so I don't ostracize anyone. I want all my friends together, because, well, they wouldn't wanna be left out, and of course why not. This led to a thing where I'd host these massive groups and just be friends with everyone, because not being friends with someone meant that you were being an ass by not inviting them.

Another thing that is kind of a factor is the fact that I still have a lot of social anxiety in one on one situations. In public settings where you are meeting people, they have the ability to escape from you. In large groups, the same (they can just start talking to someone else, or go back to the activity that everyone is doing). In one on one settings, someone can hate you and you have no way of knowing, they just sat through the meal because they were being polite.
