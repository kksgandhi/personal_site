sort of a [[gestalt]], but for [[learning]]

 - Multimedia
   - Pictures + Words, rather than just words ([[dual channel theory]])
 - Spatial
   - put things near each other
 - Temporal
   - put things near each other
 - coherence
   - remove extraneous things
 - modality
   - animation and narration rather than animation and text
 - redundancy
   - animation and narration rather than animation, text, and narration (hilarious how the bullet on redundancy feels redundant)
 - individuality
   - instructional design makes more of an impact on high knowledge learners (does this mean smart learners, or learners with a lot of background...)
 - signaling
   - underlining + arrows
 - pacing
   - let students control pacing
 - concepts first
   - [[learning - pretrain]]
 - personalization
   - use "you" or "yours"
 - human voice
   - no machine voice or foreign accents
