It can be easy to look at a group of [[the other]] and assume that they are all similar in view and extremism â€” that they are unified. The reality may be that you only see a slice of that group, and there's more infighting then you would expect.

Sometimes it may seem like a group is [[hypocrisy|hypocritical]] in their beliefs, but maybe you've just seen two different ideas from two different people.
