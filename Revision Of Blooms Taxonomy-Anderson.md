The first few pages have a great breakdown / summary.

[[learning objectives]]

important organizing questions:

 - learning
   - What is important for students to learn
 - instruction
   - How can we deliver instruction
 - Assessment
   - How to accurately determine whether students have learned?
 - Alignment
   - Are the 3 things above consistent with each other?

 - Factual
   - Basic terminology
 - Conceptual
   - Relations between concepts
 - Procedural
   - How to do something
 - [[metacognitive knowledge|Meta-Cognitive]]
   - Knowledge about strategy
   - Self Knowledge

When making an assessment, note what stage of the cognitive process you are assessing and make sure you are assessing only that stage.

 - classify
   - sort into categories
 - explain
   - construct a cause->effect model
 - attribute
   - determine the POV, bias, values, or intent underlying presented material

Chapter 2 has some criticisms of learning objectives, in that they can be too general, that not every student responds in the same way.
