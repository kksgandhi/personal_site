Brings up an interesting variation of the [[trolley problem]], the [[Churchill problem]]

[[doctrine of double effect]]

[[fat man problem]]

My god there's a lot of [[trolley problems]]

[[torture]]

[[intent]]

this thing has too many trolley problems. p83 introduces two more

[[x-phi]]

p109 goes into some [[epistemology]] and [[JTB]] theory

showing the [[looped trolley problem]] or the [[fat man problem]] before [[SPUR]] causes people to change how they view SPUR

If the puller *wants* to kill the one person in SPUR, people find it unethical.

 - captain eating his cabin boy
 - blowing up the fat man w/ dynamite
 - pushing the freezing man off the ladder
 - Sophie's choice
 - The conjoined twin seperations
 - smother a child to save from the Nazis?
   - there's apparently a gender divide with this one, but not the lifeboat jettison problem
 - jettison from the lifeboat?

there was a real life surgeon case with a doctor who killed a guy faster for his organs (he was dying anyways). He claimed [[DDE]] that he was just giving painkiller meds to give him comfort.

![[unconscious morality]]

[[the man with a tumor]]

Brain damage, an inability to visualize things, blunted emotions, all of these can make you have less of an emotional response to morality.

Is it moral to [[mind modification|modify your mind]] to be a better person? A happier person? Reminds me of the [[experience machine]]

the [[ultimatum game]]
