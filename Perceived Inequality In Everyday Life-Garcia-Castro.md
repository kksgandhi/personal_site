Has a few simple questions that measure inequality

**Perceived Economic Inequality in everyday life.**
Adapted from (García-Castro et al., 2019), a single item measures this variable. We asked participants  to report the frequency of perceived economic inequality in their everyday life by answering the  following question (from 1 = never, to 5 = very frequently): “How often do you see situations of  economic inequality in your daily life?” PEIEL’s measures in recent studies have shown satisfactory  validity evidences (see Melita et al., 2021; Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2020).

**Intolerance of inequality**
This study considered a single item commonly used in international surveys (e.g., ISSP Research  Group, 2017). Participants were questioned about their level of agreement or disagreement (1 = totally  agree, 5 = totally disagree) with the following question: “In Chile, income differences are too large.”  This measure was conceptualized as tolerance of inequality (Gonthier, 2017; Larsen, 2016; Schröder,   2017). Considering higher scores of this measure have been shown to mean lower tolerance for  inequality, we designate said measure as intolerance of inequality. 

**Attitudes toward redistribution**
Two items adapted from Dawtry et al. (2015) were used to measure support for redistributive policies.  Participants were questioned about their level of agreement or disagreement (1 = totally agree,  5 = totally disagree) with the following statements: “I think the government should redistribute wealth  charging higher taxes to rich people.” and “Wealth in this country should be distributed more  equitably, also reaching groups with fewer resources.” The results from these two items were then  averaged to produce one score at each given time (r ranging from .53 to .61).
