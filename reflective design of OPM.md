 - emotional challenge
   - and balancing said emotional challenge
 - priming players for reflection

Khaled:

 - games should not have safe environments
 - games should not contain simplistic answers
 - Immersion is counter to reflection
 - Avoid stealth learning
 - Don't design for everyone

Reflective Survey:

 - Game elements that surround the message, support the message
 - Games enable the intellectual exploration of various perspectives
 - Relating the message to the player increases its power
 - Respect the player's intelligence with subtle messages, slowly built.

Urban Planning paper:

 - Text
   - how much text is appropriate in a game?
   - how to balance player annoyance with the game
   - should be meaningful, timely, and diegetic

 - Distance and relevance?
   - Identity?

It sounds like what you're doing is embedded design...

 - Intermixing:
   - Balance on message and off message content
 - Obfuscating:
   - Use framing devices to divert focus away from the game's message
 - Distancing:
   - Use fiction to increase the gap between player identity and persuasive content.
