Highlighting some tech that's private, sustainable, and importantly, doesn't require you to be techy to use.

Why Bother?
-----------

**Privacy** isn't just about peeping toms. Companies harvest your data for advertisers (or special interests) who want to manipulate you. Companies, wanting your data, employ [deceptive design](https://www.deceptive.design/) to keep you addicted to their site. Using private tech means the tech works for you, not the other way around. 

**Sustainability** isn't just about the environment. Tech that's built to last saves you money and prevents a headache if something small breaks â€” no need to buy a whole new device.
