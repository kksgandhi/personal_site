 - All games can include learning, the binary is not useful.
 - Serious games often simplify issues in an unquestioning way.
   - This can lead to the trivialization of important issues.
 - Students were quick to critique the game design, they talked about it before even talking about the social issues of the game.
 - argues (with not as much evidence as I'd like), that learning happens over long periods of time, and that short games may not be as effective.
 - [[realism in edugames|Realism]] is a complex topic, and it's unclear what makes someone feel like a game is realistic or not. (maybe reread this section.)
 - [[players don't read|Players don't read]]
