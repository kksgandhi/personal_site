Hi! I'm Kutub Gandhi. Welcome to my... blog?

This website contains *all* my notes, so watch out — some stuff might be outdated or written without much thought.

I'm a 5th year PhD student with the wonderful [Seth Cooper](http://www.khoury.neu.edu/home/scooper/) (Northeastern University Department of Computer Science).

I study [[educational games]], with a focus on [[reflective games|games that ask their players to reflect]] — touching on concepts in social issues, [[critical thinking]], and [[philosophical games|philosophy]]. I got started in undergrad, where I [[Coll 182|taught a course that used games to teach philosophy]]. Through my work, I've gained strong skills in game design, pedagogy, user research, and programming.
