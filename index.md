Hi! I'm Kutub Gandhi.

This website is a dump of all my notes. And when I say all, I mean *all*. It also doubles as a blog of sorts. I take notes using [[Obsidian]], so these pages are probably easier to read and navigate if you had the program ([download this site here](https://github.com/kksgandhi/personal_site)). I recognize that not everyone wants to download an app though, hence why I have this site.
