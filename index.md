Hi!

I'm Kutub Gandhi. Welcome to my sort-of blog

**THIS WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND IS NOT COMPLETE.** If you found yourself here, feel free to look around, but please don't judge too hard haha

This website is a dump of all my notes. And when I say all, I mean *all*. It also doubles as a blog of sorts. I take notes using [[Obsidian]], so these pages are probably easier to read and navigate if you had the program ([link here if you do have the program](https://github.com/kksgandhi/personal_site)). I recognize that not everyone wants to download an app though, hence why I have this site.
