Hi! I'm Kutub Gandhi. Welcome to my... blog?

This website contains *all* my notes, so watch out — some stuff might be outdated or written without much thought.

--------------

I'm a 5th year PhD student with the wonderful [Seth Cooper](http://www.khoury.neu.edu/home/scooper/) (Northeastern University Department of Computer Science).

I study [[educational games]], with a focus on social impact. How can we get players to [[reflective games|reflect]] and think [[critical thinking|critically]] about the world they live in? I got started in undergrad, where I [[Coll 182|taught a course that used games to teach philosophy]]. Through my work, I've gained strong skills in game design, pedagogy, user research, and programming.

I'll be looking for jobs in the fall and would love to get connected — I'm interested in design / programming / user research for educational games; I'm also looking to teach computer science / game design at the university level.
