Hi! I'm Kutub Gandhi. Welcome to my... blog?

This website is a dump of all my notes. And when I say all, I mean *all*. I take notes using [[Obsidian]], a wonderful tool (And hey, if you have Obsidian, [download the website here](https://github.com/kksgandhi/personal_site) and view it within Obsidian, it'll probably be a better experience)
