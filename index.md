Hi! I'm Kutub Gandhi. Welcome to my... blog?

This website contains *all* my notes, so watch out — some stuff might be outdated or written without much thought.

How can we get players to [[reflective games|reflect]] and think [[critical thinking|critically]] about themselves and the world they live in?

I study play, with a focus on social impact. I'm a 6th year PhD student with the wonderful [Seth Cooper](http://www.khoury.neu.edu/home/scooper/) (Northeastern University Department of Computer Science). I got started in undergrad, where I [[Coll 182|taught a course that used games to teach philosophy]]. 

My CS background has given me a strong base in programming, and through my research, I've gained expertise in game design, pedagogy, working with children, and user research.

I'll be looking for jobs in the fall and would love to get connected — I'm interested in educational technology: design, user research, programming, and product management all appeal to me. I'm also looking to teach computer science / game design at the university level.

If you want to play one of my games, try this one out (it's 10 minutes long and works on desktop or mobile!):
