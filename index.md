Hi!

I'm Kutub Gandhi. Welcome to my sort-of blog

**THIS WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND IS NOT COMPLETE.** If you found yourself here, feel free to look around, but please don't judge too hard haha

This website is a dump of all my notes. And when I say all, I mean *all*. It also doubles as a blog of sorts. I take notes using Obsidian, so these pages are probably easier to read and navigate if you had the program. I recognize that not everyone wants to download an app though, hence why I have this site.

Because this is a dump of *all* my notes, a couple of disclaimers are in order:

 - Sorry if notes are incomplete, incoherent, or unnavigable. There's a lot of dead links around here, though I'll try to clean up some of the worst offenders.
 - These notes should not be taken as well researched bastions of information. Quite frankly they should be taken as the incoherent ramblings of a madman.
 - If you disagree with my opinions in something I've written, please don't hate me. Instead, contact me. I'm always curious to hear new opinions and learn!
 - I don't strongly stand by any opinions in here, most of the stuff I've written is kinda off the cuff instead of formally being "a statement of my convictions"
