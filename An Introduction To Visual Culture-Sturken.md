   - such as artisanal brands which reject corporate branding
 - one of the first examples of consumer citizenship was soap

Chapter 8

 - postmodernism eschews modernist thought like positivism, the unified self, the idea that beliefs can be justified on reason alone
 - skepticism of science arose when "pure" science made horrific things happen, like the atomic bomb
 - metanarratives claim to explain everything. Postmodernism hates them
 - [[The Precession of Simulacra]]
 - we are parts of the systems we critique.
 - the idea of a human, of mankind prioritizes normatism
 - postmodernism: There's nothing new under the sun
 - nonplaces: spaces between, of transit, that have function but little value. Modernism is functional, meaningful. Postmodernism is ironic, kitschy, and playful. The Highline in NYC
