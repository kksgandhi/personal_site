I had taught individual lectures and helped students, but it had been a long time since I'd managed a full class. Some big moments from the class:

 - Staying organized, keeping track of what grades were posted, what materials needed to be put together, who has extensions. I eventually made a spreadsheet. The rows were every item I needed to get done before or after a class (e.g. before, get the slides ready. After, post the exercise solutions) and the columns were each class date. I'd check off items as I got them done.
 - C++ is a class with a lot of fiddly syntax, so keeping students engaged was challenging. Solutions:
   - Connect to history. Why is the syntax the way it is?
   - Reflect on program design. What does a certain feature allow you to do?
   - Create interesting moments. I set up a tricky piece of code, then asked students what it did. I used the moment, when students realized the trickery, to emphasize some of the subtleties of C++
 - Keeping students from "spiraling". The class was accelerated, so if students missed even a week, that could lead to them being unable to catch up. I should have proactively reached out more and kept a closer eye on students who weren't submitting assignments.
 - Creating policies: Students very often asked for extensions or had medical issues and it was tough figuring out what was appropriate to give extensions for. I actually know a professor who has a general "hardship" policy, but won't look at medical excuses or family excuses beyond that.
