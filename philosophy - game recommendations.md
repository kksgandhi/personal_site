### The Beginner's Guide (2 hours)

Short, but with a powerful message. I think everyone should try this game (mostly so I can discuss it with you) 

Mass Appeal: 10, though trigger warning: Depression, not a casual game

### The Stanley Parable (3-4 hours)

Great game about free will and the life we are all stuck in. Another game that's short enough that I feel like everyone should try it.

Mass Appeal: 10

### Disco Elysium (20ish hours)

What an experience. The voices and music still ring through my head, the characters and setting are so well fleshed out. This game is basically a novel, a choose your own adventure novel amped up to the maximum, with visuals and audio to boot.

Mass Appeal: 8

### Spec Ops: The Line (8-10 hours)

An intense commentary on the military and the brutal wars we start. Trigger warning: war crimes

Mass Appeal: 6 (For gore and an incredibly intensive story)

### Papers Please (6-8 hours)

Working as border security in a parody of eastern block communism, you have to bend your ethics in order for your family to survive. An incredibly well made game to show how even well meaning people's ethics die after a thousand cuts.

Mass Appeal: 9

### [[The Talos Principle]] (20-30 hours)

This game taught me more philosophy than any textbook ever could. Beautiful story, beautiful message, and tons of neat puzzles. The actual philosophy of the game is varied, but touches on what it means to be human, religion, consciousness, AI, and meaning of life. [[The Talos Principle|Click here for some video essays that summarize the game without you having to play the whole long thing]]

Mass Appeal 6 (It's very long, and while I think the length helps the game's message soak in, it is still a problem)

### The Witness (30+ hours)

A Zen garden of puzzles with a beautiful message, though it doesn't really tell you the message until late into the game. Beautifully designed

Mass Appeal: 5 (For reasons why, check out my note on [[The Witness]])

### Antichamber (20-30 hours)

Mind bending puzzle game, teaches you to not always focus on the obvious solution. Not ultra philosophical, but still tons of fun with a neat message.

Mass Appeal: 8

### [[Opera Omnia]] (2-3 hours)

Are the facts really the facts? Is the blood on your hands if you didn't do the killing? A few more thoughts in my [[Opera Omnia|note on the game]]

Mass Appeal: 3

### Dujanah (4-5 hours)

A painful and complex story about dealing with grief. This game is actively painful to play, just like grief is painful.

Mass Appeal: 1
