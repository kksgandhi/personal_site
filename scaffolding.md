[[learning]]

[[Video Games and Moral Pedagogy-Staines]] quotes James Paul Gee (2004, p113). I paraphrase here:

Learning is best done when the knowledge is immediately applicable, and thus "learning by doing", learning inside the very context where you are using the information is best. On the other hand, humans are not very good at simply being left to their own devices within complex contexts about which they know very little.

So, the best way to teach is to create lesson plans that link learning to doing all while providing enough structure so that students don't get lost.
