 - players mentioned simple [[game juice|enjoyment]] in games.
   - tautologically, a player is more likely to [[games - engagement|engage]] with an engaging game. Seems reasonable to believe that engagement would extend to engagement with the message.
   - heck, there are probably many games that have awesome messages, but were put down because they were simply boring.
 - Background details, atmosphere, and lore can all contribute to this enjoyment
 - the abstract [[aesthetics]] contribute as well, e.g. the difficulty of [[Dark Souls]] makes people reflect on [[perseverance]]
 - Players both noticed (and were excited to notice) when [[tying message and mechanics|game mechanics meshed with more abstract themes]].
 - [[4th wall breaking]] is a good tool too.

[[subversion]] is a powerful tool, but you have to have a deep understanding of basic game development in order to employ subversion properly.
