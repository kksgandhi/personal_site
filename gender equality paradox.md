certain gender equality metrics are actually worse in countries that have strong economies or progressive views on gender.

For pay differential specifically, this is likely because poorer countries tend to have lower pay generally and worse social safety nets, so women in those countries force themselves into high paying careers and endure sexist workplaces to avoid ending up destitute. Thus, women end up in high paying jobs at a higher rate, despite facing increased sexism. ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKc_8fT6pGc), I think)
