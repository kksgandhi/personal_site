My hours of thinking about ethics don't actually make me a nicer person, don't affect how I do things day to day. Regardless, these ideas [[trickle down]] and affect my other views, allow me to speak intelligently and with logic about practical, modern concerns. Learning about [[abstractions]] allows me to adapt to novel problems.

I mean I'm still a dumbass, but philosophy helps a little bit.
