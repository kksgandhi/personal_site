My hours of thinking about ethics don't actually make me a nicer person, don't affect how I do things day to day. Regardless, these ideas [trickle down](trickle%20down.md) and affect my other views, allow me to speak intelligently and with logic about practical, modern concerns.

I mean I'm still a dumbass, but philosophy helps a little bit.
