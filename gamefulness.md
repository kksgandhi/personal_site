rule structured, challenging pursuit of goals

gamefulness is the intrinsic part of the game that can't be stripped away. The platforming in Mario is the gamefulness, the scoredboard is the gamification.

When learning goals are implemented in a gameful way, that's known as [[intrinsic integration]]
