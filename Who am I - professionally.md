I am a PhD student, [[research|researching]] [[games]] at Northeastern university with the wonderful [Seth Cooper](http://www.khoury.neu.edu/home/scooper/) (Department of Computer Science).

My interests primarily lie in [[educational games]], with a specific focus on [[reflective games|games that ask their players to reflect on themselves and the world around them]] — touching on concepts in [[critical thinking]], social issues, and [[philosophical games|philosophy]]. 

These interests arose from [[Coll 182|a course I taught in undergraduate]] where I used games like [[The Stanley Parable]], [[The Talos Principle]], and [[The Witness]] to teach [[philosophy]]. Why read about the [[trolley problem]], when you can instead play through it yourself?

I also run the Game Philosophy Network's [unofficial discord for game academics.](https://discord.gg/QPzvX5NfX9)
