At the moment I [[research]] [[games]] at Northeastern university with the wonderful [Seth Cooper](http://www.khoury.neu.edu/home/scooper/).

My interests primarily lie in [[educational games]], with a specific focus on [[reflective games|games that ask their players to reflect on themselves and the world around them]] — touching on concepts in [[critical thinking]] and [[philosophical games|philosophy]]. Summed up: why read about the trolley problem, when you can instead play through it yourself? These interests arose from [[Coll 182|a course I taught in undergraduate]] where I used games like [[The Stanley Parable]], [[The Talos Principle]], and [[The Witness]] to teach [[philosophy]]. I have a background in Computer Science, getting my Bachelor's at Rice University.

I also run the Game Philosophy Network's [unofficial discord for game academics.](https://discord.gg/QPzvX5NfX9)
