We using a thing called MAADS

 - Puzzle Errors
   - Code runs but does not solve the problem
 - Structure errors
   - Non-trivial syntax errors, such as not including a main method
 - Reasoning errors
   - Using methods on the wrong objects, etc.

So it seems like they essentially made a compiler that was smart enough to identify errors and paths of reasoning automagically
