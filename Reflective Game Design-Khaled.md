[[conventional game design works against reflection]]

refers to reflection using the definition I usually ascribe to [[critical thinking]]

[[trivializing a game leads to worse learning outcomes]]

Crookall Hofstede: games need a [[debrief]] section for players to let the learning outcomes soak in.

[[immersion is counter to reflection]], but maybe [[projective identity hypothesis|we are more likely to listen to a character we associate with]]

[[critical design]] is not "user friendly", though avoid challenging to the point where the art is alienating.

[[cost and challenge]]: If we pay for a game, we're far more annoyed if it's subversive or not a straightforwardly entertaining experience.

some discussion on [[Art Game]] and how it doesn't set goals for players / has "irritating" elements to aid in immersion and [[irritation triggers reflection|reflection triggering]].

Also discussed the game [[Joust - game]]
