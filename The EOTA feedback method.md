A framework for setting up [[playtesting|playtests]] and getting useful [[feedback]].

EOTA is:

 - Experience
   - Playtesters talk about simple experiences
 - Observe
   - Secondary observers talk about what they saw with the playtesters
 - Theorize
   - Think about why certain experiences or dynamics occurred
 - Advise
   - Give specific and actionable advice.

Jessica Hammer advocates for picking a number of people to speak *before* anyone starts speaking. That way, the people you pick will think about what they wanted to say without getting biased by the first person.
