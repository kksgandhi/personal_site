From [[Grounded Theory-Hook]]:

 - start with open coding, code with free association, line by line, paragraph by paragraph, tagging each idea with maybe a simple sentence or even a word.
   * A participant may talk about a chance to achieve new things, which you could code simply with "achieving"
 - Group codes together into concepts, though for novelty's sake, avoid only using concepts others have established.
 - Group again into a few core categories, each describing some significant phenomenon.
 - Code, but specifically for codes related to the core category/categories
 - (A bit of history, grounded theory has evolved a bunch. One form is constructivist grounded theory, which focuses on how theories are *constructed* by participants and researchers, rather than being discovered)
