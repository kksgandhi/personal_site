The meaning of video games is a wide topic, wider than what applies to stereotypical gamers

[[ludology]] vs [[narratology]], but either way what is ignored is that games emerge as industrial commodities.

There is an overemphasis on creative labor as opposed to workers who produce consoles or sales people (I don't agree with this, of course they are important, but are they important in the meaning?)

the industry uses the [[volunteer labor]] of modders, modders extend the community and the industry takes notice

video game form and narratives are codified and embody the power relationships in society

media created by capital transmits its own ideas about what is legitimate capital, usually [[high culture]]

unlike [[economic capital]], [[social capital]] is useful in some circumstances but useless in others. An Ivy League degree is an example of this

every worker has a different level of cultural, social, and economic capital

as games worm their way into collective consciousness, their social capital grows and there will be friction over what that social capital looks like. Parents, regulators, and non-game critics all do not have game capital, but do have other forms of capital
