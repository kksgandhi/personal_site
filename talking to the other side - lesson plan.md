Changing hearts and minds

There are people out there who, for some reason, don't spend their Saturday nights reading obscure philosophy texts. If you can't throw 500 pages of Hegel at someone to change their mind, how the heck are you supposed to do it? This week we'll be discussing colloquial philosophy: The sort of structured-but-not-really-structured arguments people make in everyday life. In addition, we'll pull on Haidt's theories of moral intuitionism to understand the psychological and societal bases for how people form and change their minds on foundational things.
