There's a lot of introduction and negative stuff about [[GBL]]... talks about lack of randomization in some games studies 

Research questions:

 - does the instructional media affect positive affect?
 - does the personality trait of competitiveness affect the effect of media. 
 - Do positive affect and flow levels induced by the instructional medium mediate the influence of the medium on learning outcomes?
 - [[GBL]] vs [[DGBL]]?

debate-based educational method on a computer game, non-computer game, and non-game workshop.

Used a game called [[Europe 2045]]

Watson 1988 on positive affect

competition in education. Is it beneficial? Who knows... but probably, given the following features: each participant has a reasonable chance of winning, the rules around wining are clearly specified, and winning is relatively unimportant.

use a two dimensional conceptualization of [[competition|competitiveness]]

does positive affect influence learning outcomes? puts forward a rationale based on [[CATLM]]. Do games take up cognitive load or increase available cognitive load?

GBL vs DGBL? what if people aren't used to digital games? what if there are 

jesus they got a lot of participants...

removed computer specific aspects of the game since they were measuring [[GBL]] vs [[DBGL]]

Reminds me of the [[The Sudan Game-Landwehr]]

competitiveness was a benefit to learning...

has some good questionnaires in the appendix...
