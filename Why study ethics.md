Studying ethics doesn't necessarily make someone a more ethical person, as a matter of fact I feel like [[empathy]] and [[diversity|meeting diverse people]] would do you a lot better there. [In fact, there's some evidence that ethics professors aren't actually any more ethical than us.](https://qz.com/1582149/ethicists-are-no-more-ethical-than-the-rest-of-us-study-finds/)

While I wouldn't expect someone to apply "Utilitarianism" to day to day decisions, I think an understanding of ethics is important to design larger systems. I feel like my understanding of [[deontology]] helps me understand why our legal system is set up the way it is, and helps me think through proposals for a better one.

While this certainly doesn't apply to everyone, I'm particularly interested in ethics because I'm interested in the topic of [[AI ethics]]. If we have an all powerful robot mind that understands systems and humans better than we ever could, how should it act?
