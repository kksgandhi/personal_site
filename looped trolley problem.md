p41 [[Would You Kill The Fat Man-Edmonds]]

Ostensibly the DDE can explain the difference between the [[trolley problem]] and the [[fat man problem]] since you don't intend to kill with the trolley problem.

I'd argue that you don't intend to kill the fat man, but even still, the loop problem indicates that it's not a simple matter of the DDE that makes a difference since in the loop problem you need him to die to save the 5. (still don't agree, you don't intend for him to die here)
