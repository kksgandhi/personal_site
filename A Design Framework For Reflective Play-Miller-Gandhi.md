The core of this paper is a set of [[game design lenses|lenses]], useful in creating [[reflective games]]. You can find these lenses [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1caIPfT_bBRqk28Vn7g9kKtnu9zIfYghle9LW3wcHht4/edit#slide=id.g29b30759f1c_0_587).

If you want to go deeper, the paper itself has an extensive literature review, deeper discussion on each of the lenses (including related work and example games), and some exercises where we use the lenses in practice (to evaluate an existing game, and to create a new game).
