You build a system that sends doctors notifications. It's an aggressive system, beeping at them even when things are mostly ok.

The manager of a hospital requires doctors to work 12 hour shifts.

A doctor gets a notification, but is too tired to check it properly. They assume it's not important anyways. For that reason, someone dies.

Who's fault is it? Ostensibly the doctor's, but we ignore every other system that could have contributed. This is important when we [[this shouldn't happen again|don't want something to happen again.]]
