I think it's true that money can't buy happiness, though there are a lot of nuances. I think the original statement is obvious enough and not really writing about, so let's talk about the nuances.

Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy security, and a lack of security really hurts you in the [[hierarchy of needs]]. It's hard to self actualize when you are worried about where you are going to sleep that night.

Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy time. Time lets you work on yourself, build things that make you happy.

Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy therapy.

Also it's pretty bullshit that "money can't buy happiness" is used to counter people pointing out [[systematic inequality]] or requesting basic human rights.
