People bully because they want to feel superior to others. As I've grown older, I've realized that a lot of people my age still have the desire to bully, they're just smarter about it, picking targets that are socially acceptable to bully.

Why is someone being aggressive? Is it because they genuinely believe it's the right move, or because they are looking for an excuse to get their aggression out?
