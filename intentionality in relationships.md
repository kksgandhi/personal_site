When you are around your partner, you have fun, and you talk about issues, but these random spots of togetherness aren't a replacement for intentionally creating spaces for fun and seriousness.

 - A week's worth of "let's watch an episode of TV before going to bed" doesn't make up for a concrete date night where the goal is to be together and relax
 - A week's worth of serious pillow talks is not enough to make up for a space where you sit down and talk about the issues in the relationship and think about compromises / ways to move forward.

Though what the fuck do I know honestly
