Being unkind pays back immediately, being kind pays back in subtler, longer term ways. 

I have people I trust, people who respect me, and the simple existence of these people in my life has been invaluable. In tough times, emotionally or just materially, I know that there are people I can call on. I wouldn't have these people if I were an asshole... I'm sure I'd have people I hung out with, but I doubt I'd have people I could truly trust.

Yes this note sounds cliche as all hell, no I don't care. Deal with it.
