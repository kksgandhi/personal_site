Razbuten [has a good series on how gaming can feel like to people who are 'non-gamers'](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLordXx8iNEyStcX_WzqM0JCpiJYgqhinc)

Some insights from the first video:

 - Controllers have "hidden buttons" like L3 (press down on joystick). Make those buttons clearer
 - [[just in time learning|JIT]] is important, as is reminders
 - waypoints and compasses are often ignored, especially if they are introduced at the same time as a bunch of other information.
 - learning the wrong lesson is common. Make it clear *why* someone failed.
 - nongamers are likely to assume games are "cooler than they actually are". Games are technically very limited, but a non-gamer might assume they can "do anything"
