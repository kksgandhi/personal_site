Similarly to my thoughts on [[anger]], I feel weird about pain. Many of my biggest productive life changes have come from my being in pain. As a matter of fact, I often put myself in painful situations because I recognize that I grow a lot from [[do things|doing things]].

At the same time, simply living contently is key to [[eudaimonia]]. Should you throw yourself into things, or should you be happy with who you are?
