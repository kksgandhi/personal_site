When I started researching educational games, I was too boxed into my notion of what an educational game was. I thought that it had to be an isolated *thing* that someone would play, be educated by, and then they'd move on with their lives.

Breaking free of that mold was really helpful. A game can be:

 - A 10 second interactive section in an article.
 - A 10 minute supplement to homework.
 - Part of a facilitated workshop, where the game presents ideas, but the workshop is where the discussion and learning actually happens.
 - As simple as a few rules on a sheet of paper.

Heck, you don't even have to build a game to get the benefits of game based learning. You can leverage:

 - Interactivity, by implementing techniques in [[active learning]].
 - Engagement, by using visuals and other media.
 - Competition, through points, badges, and leaderboards.
 - Customized learning, by using software to track student success and deploy specific interventions for students that need them.
 - Realistic scenarios, by giving out projects and [[scaffolding|scaffolded]] real world scenarios.
