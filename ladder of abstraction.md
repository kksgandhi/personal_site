Not exactly, but reminds me a bit of [[subgoal learning]]

To understand a city, you want to walk around a bit, but you also want a map. Both levels of abstraction have benefits and drawbacks, and jumping between the two is powerful.

Take a variable, jump up in levels of abstraction until you've explained everything about that variable. Then, when you introduce a new variable, jump back down to the bottom.
