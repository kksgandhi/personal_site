[[Schrier]] claims that ethical thinking is the thought process of determining how to live a good ethical life, as opposed to [[ethics]] which is codified.

I believe that ethical thinking involves breaking down and analyzing ethical situations. You can people this skill without actually codifying what the right or wrong thing to do is in any situation.

For example, you can tell people what the right or wrong answer is in the [[trolley problem]], or you can help them break down the various factors and let them come to their own conclusion.
