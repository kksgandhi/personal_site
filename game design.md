A lot of my work is on [[transformational games]]#, so check out the notes around that. Specifically [[designing transformational games]]

Books that talk about game design:
  
In terms of basic game design, the book everyone talks about is _The Art of Game Design_ by Jesse Schell. In edugames, it's _The Transformational Framework_ by Sabrina Culyba. (Even for entertainment designers, I suggest reading it, since it gives you an interesting perspective on connecting with players). I've also heard good things about Tynan Sylvester's _Designing Games._ For Game AI, there's _AI For Games_ by Ian Millington and _Artificial Intelligence and Games_ by Georgios N. Yannakakis and Julian Togelius  
  
For more casual resources, I'm a fan of _Game Maker's Toolkit_ and _AI and Games_ on YouTube.
