How do you build moral systems in games if players can just rewind the consequences by loading a past save? 

[[Undertale]] handles this by having saving be a diegetic part of the game that characters react to and comment on.

[[The Witcher]] handles this by having gameplay consequences be delayed. If a player wants to rewind, they'll lose a lot of progress.

While not about morality specifically, some games like [[Outer Wilds]] or [[Slay the Spire]] handle it by having an in-game explanation of why the player character "restarts" after dying. (with [[Outer Wilds]] specifically disallowing saving and rewinding)
