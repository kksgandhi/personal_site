There was a story about a hospital requesting a piece of patient management software: It would warn doctors when patients were had some critical issue. But then they added warnings when a patient was near critical. After all, isn't that important as well? Then they added more warnings and more notifications and more warnings. And in a perfect world, all these would be important and useful for the doctor and it would make patient outcomes better. Of course, what actually happened was that doctors got burnt out on the notifications and ignored them altogether. When designing remember that we don't live in a perfect world.
