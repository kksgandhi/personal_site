Everything you consider consciousness is not your brain doing things, but rather your brain justifying why it took the actions it did. Consciousness is not a thing of its own, but rather a narrative inserted after the fact. This has two benefits: (1) We can better reason about our actions if we have a view of ourselves as agents, and (2), the ability to justify our actions allows us to communicate with each other.

This is why [[communication|communication requires a strong sense of the self]]
