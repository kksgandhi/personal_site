[[collateral damage|Collateral damage]] is ok, as long as it wasn't the intended outcome of a moral action

This can collapse into consequentialism, but serves as a good [[load bearing argument]]

DDE says things are ok if:

 - the act is ok, independent of its harmful effects
 - The agent intends the good, and doesn't intend the bad, either as a means or an end
 - There is no way to do the good without doing the bad
 - The harmful effects are not disproportionately large relative to the good being sought.

Sometimes I'm afraid of the DDE being used in normal conversation as a shield, even when people did secretly intend the collateral damage.

To what extent does intent matter? [[killing or letting die]]
