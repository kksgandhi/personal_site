The entire world could be an illusion perpetuated by an evil demon (or mad scientist, or hallucination, etc.), and you would have no way of proving that that was the case. Any experiment you tried would necessarily be part of the illusion as well, and "breaking out of the illusion" would be impossible unless the demon allowed you. This is one of the fundamental problems of [[epistemology]], specifically the [[kk principle]]
