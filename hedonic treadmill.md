Happiness fades.

Let's say you start a job with a million dollar yearly salary. The first year you'll be living it up, partying and buying fancy things. By the second year you might have a fancy home. By the third year, maybe you'll still be riding high, but it'll be more normal to you. By a decade, it'll just be your life, and you'll be back to being a miserable wreck. [[money can't buy happiness]]

This isn't specific to money though. Any event that provides happiness will eventually fade. Instead of looking for happiness, look for meaning. There is no meaning treadmill. No one can ever take that away from you.
