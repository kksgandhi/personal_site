[[agency]], it's pretty great. Game designers allow us to inhabit different agencies, and by doing so, we better understand our own agency.

[[achievement play]] and [[striving play]]

Although games are limited, they embody limitations we aren't used to, and thus force us out of habits and into learning.

Games allow us to look at actions in a different way, seeing the beauty in them when we might be generally overwhelmed.

[[object arts]] vs [[process art]]

[[value clarity]], though players of games shouldn't expect the same value clarity irl

[[gamification can lead to overmetricing]], though the aesthetics of games and the fact that we see our actions in subtle, sensitive terms, can ameliorate this effect.

Discussion Questions
--------------------

 - When games are inherently limited, does that allow for a better understanding of agency, or is it a negative that we should overcome?
 - Is the fact that games are authored by others a form of subservience? What does it mean to transmit agency?
 - Is value clarity a negative? Are games too simplistic in how they represent the world?
 - What did you think about games fostering the aesthetics of action?
