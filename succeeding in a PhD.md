There are four major things you can do after your PhD, and success means something different for each one.

 - Academia (continuing research, either as a postdoc or professor)
   - Universities want grants. Does your work get grants? What's your plan for getting money to the university?
   - Early in your PhD, your advisor will be the one writing and deciding on grant applications. You don't necessarily need to write grant applications yourself, but you should ask how well your work fits with the kinds of grants that are available. Later in your PhD writing some grants might be more reasonable.
 - Industry: (Working at a company)
   - Do you have industry collaborations?
   - Is your work related (even tangentially) to the kinds of problems companies face?
   - Have you done industry internships?
 - Non-profits and the government.
   - Admittedly I don't know too much about this, but it is a viable path.
 - Teaching at a university
   - How much teaching experience do you have?
     - Lecturing?
     - Building assignments?
     - Working with students?
     - Teaching something you're unfamiliar with.
