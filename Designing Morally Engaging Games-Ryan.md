Background talks about [[Neo-Kohlbergianism]] and the [[Minnesota approach]]

They don't like [[metriced morality systems]]

 - Lens of Moral Focus
   * Place players in a position of moral responsibility, e.g. in SPOPS, the main character has a commitment to saving the citizens of Dubai.
   * [[players don't need the basic stuff explained to them]]
   * [[NPCs can comment on player actions]]
   * Questions to consider:
     + Why is morality a priority, what motivates the player to treat moral decisions as moral decisions instead of instrumental ones.
     + Do players role play a moral identity. If so, how does it impact their behavior?
     + Are players given opportunities to reflect on their behavior?
     + What are the consequences of immoral decisions? Watch for ludonarrative dissonance
 - Lens of Moral Sensitivity
   * Recognizing moral issues in the real world, and recognizing what you can do about them.
   * In [[Deus Ex]] you overhear someone abusing a prostitute and can step in to act (but the game doesn't force you to)
   * In [[Mass Effect|ME2]], you can act morally in "quicktime events", but the authors dislike it because it's more a reflexes check than a morality check.
   * We are less likely to care about NPCs when they are shown as mega evil, and when we get EXP for killing them.
   * Questions:
     + How blunt / subtle is moral content
     + How can players express morality? Preselected options or do they actually have agency?
     + Are NPCs dehumanizable or well fleshed out?
 - Lens of Moral Judgement
   * Reasoning about morality
   * [[Fallout 3]] has the great Oasis tree quest
   * Questions:
     + Are you making [[moral temptations]] or moral dilemmas?
     + What moral matrices are touched by your dilemmas, and how do they conflict?
     + What is the process of making a moral judgement? Are they one time choices or part of larger frameworks?
     + How difficult are these dilemmas to understand and resolve?
 - Lens of Moral Action
   * Questions:
     + Does the player simply choose to act morally, or do they actually have to take actions.
     + How difficult is it to put your choices into actions, what skills do you need to have?
     + Does the action require persistence that is repeatedly challenged?
