Simulations are simulations and reality is reality.

But there's an interesting middle ground, when it doesn't *matter* if something is a simulation or reality. Some parts of your brain [[hybrid illusion theory|don't even make the distinction.]]

Let's say there are some dinosaur bones in a museum. Some are real, some are made of plaster. The difference is definitely relevant to an archaeologist, but does it matter to a child? If you want the child to be perfectly informed, tell them that the bones are fake, but for so many intents and purposes, it just... doesn't matter.
