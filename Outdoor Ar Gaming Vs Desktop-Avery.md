Typical views into [[AR]] are about increased functionality

describes a variety of indoor AR games, like mahjong and hockey

outdoor games aren't as common, because indoor games can be far more controlled

this paper is interesting, because there's a lot of auxilary stuff that might be useful to take another look at. Stuff like the favorite game types for participants, that stuff...

they had a lot of interesting minor stuff. Like they used the number of questions participants asked as a way to understand how well the instructional video worked. Basically a lot of implicit metrics done in a cool way

Ultimately they found that AR was better and easy to learn :)
