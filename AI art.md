 - Is the output ethical? Even if the AI was trained on CC images, should we use these models in lieu of an actual artist?
 - Is grabbing an image for the purposes of training ethical? What if the image is CC? What if the image is "out in public", but for people's viewing (maybe without the artist even having thought of AI training as a possibility)
 - How do we feel about paying humans to filter for AI? Is there a "fair wage"? (is there a fair wage for doing emotionally harmful things such as filtering explicit content?)
 - Will AI "homogenize" art in the same way spell check constrains the evolution of language?
