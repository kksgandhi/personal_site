A response to [[Failure Of Discovery Based Learning And Benefits Of Guided Training Methods-Clark]]

tl;dr: [[Clark]] assumed that [[problem based learning|PBL]] is unscaffolded and therefore a failure, but proper use of PBL is highly scaffolded

Heck, sometimes inquiry learning does involve direct instruction, but it's more of a [[just in time learning]] sort of thing.

[[scaffolding]] has many benefits in learning.
