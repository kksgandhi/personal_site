Why be a good person? I try to be kind, but often [[shittiness is the easy way out]].

Without going into too many details, there was a period of my life where I fell into a deep depression because I was fed a variety of stories of absolutely terrible people in my life facing no justice for what they had done.

I wrote three notes on the topic and they're all pretty terrible. I couldn't provide the specific examples and thoughts that helped me out of my depression because some of them are private, and a lot of them just won't translate well to the page unless I provide mountains of context. So eh, have three notes written as best as I could.

 - [[kindness repays subtly]]
 - [[single mindedness corrupts]]
 - [[jealousy]]
