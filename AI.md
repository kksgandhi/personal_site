AI is difficult to reason about because people tend to anthropomorphize things too much, seeing intelligence where there isn't any. At the same time, people have an anti-[[mechanistic bias]], assuming that there is something fundamentally non-mechanical about humans, something that a mechanical system could never reproduce.

Obviously, this means thinking about [[AI safety]] is hard.
