Conferences are overwhelming. It's helpful to prep a few things beforehand so you can fall back to them when your brain is much.

 - What are my goals? Are there people I want to meet? Do I have a project for which I need a collaborator?
 - What's my elevator pitch? What have I worked on that's interesting, and why?
 - What are the [[conference questions|big questions]] on my mind?
   - Asking questions helps you learn, but more cynically, it also looks impressive to others if you can ask smart questions, and keeps the conversation flowing.

After the conference, making a contact book that sorts people by field and expertise can help you stay in touch with them later.
