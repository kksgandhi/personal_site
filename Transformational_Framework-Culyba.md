Art of game design by *Schell*, apparently I should read it

Transformational games attempt to change the player irl in a manner that persists

High Level Purpose
Audience & Context
Player Transformations
Barriers
Domain Concepts
Expert Resources
Prior Works
Assessment Plan

Don't *design* something that directly features the purpose, instead think about how the design will foster the purpose.

Understand your players. What is their beginning state? (Do they know geometry)

Also understand other stakeholders such as teachers

Focus on specific transformations instead of high level goals. "The Player loves Reading" -> "The player has increased positive feelings about reading"

Hey quick question, why aren't your players already transformed? What barriers are in their way?

Motivation, Relevance, Social Norms, Access, Ability, Complexity, Unfamiliarity, Misconceptions, Fear

What concepts are you focusing on, including, or cutting?

Prior works can be any media, not just games

Mediating variables: x and y are not causated, instead x -> z -> y. Instead of targeting x -> y, target x -> z. Studies show that improving self-efficacy can lead people to quit. Maybe don't target "quitting smoking", but rather "self-efficacy"

Moderating variables: x -> y is dependant on z. Students need basic algebra to learn calc, so only target students who know basic algebra
