Art of game design by [[Schell]], apparently I should read it

transformational games are specifically about [[exotransformative|exotransformation]]

define the problem first. [[iterative game design]] doesn't work as well with transformational games.

The pieces of the transformational framework:

 - High Level Purpose
 - Audience & Context
 - Player Transformations
 - Barriers
 - Domain Concepts
 - Expert Resources
 - Prior Works
 - Assessment Plan

Major questions:

 - Why is it important that your game transform players?
   - Agreeing on this helps create a shared vision for your team.
 - What is the ecosystem in which your game must create change?
   - Who will play it, and where?
   - Where do your players stand before playing the game?
   - Why do your players want to transform?
     - Are they forced externally? Trying to reach a personal goal? Just interested in the topic?
   - Remember all your stakeholders
   - Do [[user research]], your stakeholders may have different desires than anticipated.
 - How should players be different after playing your game?
   - Focus on specific transformations instead of high level goals. "The Player loves Reading" -> "The player has increased positive feelings about reading"
   - Don't expect unattainable goals
   - [[types of transformation]]
 - Why aren't your players already transformed?
   - [[types of barriers to transformation]]
   - deal with the barrier (directly or indirectly), limit your audience, or simply accept the barrier
 - What is essential to include to transform your players?
   - Prioritize, don't try to cover everything
 - For fucks sake remember your [[subject matter experts|SMEs]]
 - Learn from others
 - How will you measure your game's impact?
   - [[evaluating transformational games]]

Mediating variables: x and y are not causated, instead x -> z -> y. Instead of targeting x -> y, target x -> z. Studies show that improving [[self efficacy]] can lead people to quit. Maybe don't target "quitting smoking", but rather "[[self efficacy]]"

Moderating variables: x -> y is dependant on z. Students need basic algebra to learn calc, so only target students who know basic algebra
