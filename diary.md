I like keeping a diary because it is easy for me to remember the big things that happen. The once in a lifetime sadness or happiness. I feel like what gets lost is the [[zeitgeist]] of the times, the little events that don't seem to mean much at the time, but in sum mean so much.

I've been keeping a diary since senior year of high school and what I've started doing is reading from 4 years ago as a way to feel my progress in the last 4 years.
