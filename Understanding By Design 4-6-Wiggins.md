Understanding is when students perform effectively with knowledge.

bookpg120 has a good list of essential questions to ask

Topical understandings are unit specific, while overarching understandings relate to the entire course, or maybe even bridge into other courses.

From chapter 7:

 - explanation
   - explain the big idea in your own words
 - interpret
   - make sense of ideas
 - application
   - use one's knowledge in a new context
 - perspective
   - articulate things from a different POV
 - empathy
   - understand the diversity of thought in the world
 - self-knowledge
   - How does your work show your improvement?
   - What task was the most challenging, and why?
   - which selection are you most proud of, and why?
