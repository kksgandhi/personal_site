The [[Danish]] [[language]] has two verbs and two nouns regarding games and play. 

Essentially there is a noun and a verb for "A game" and "A play" where a game is the structure and the play is the [[emergent]], fun, and [[autoelotic]] qualities of what we consider games.

The interaction of the nouns and verbs regard the interactions of structure and fun.

Soccer has strict rules for scoring and whatnot, but a couple of friends might not play by these rules in order to foster fun.
