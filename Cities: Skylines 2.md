[Notes from this playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI9CSyNWY_I)

 - much more public transit
 - surprised how this, and simcity have a large focus on wind
 - pedestrian streets!
 - parking might be built in to the stores?
 - stuff is "prebuilt", like Strong Towns argues *against* doing.
 - uses development points along with currency
 - also relies on zoning
 - tweets constantly show up, they feel natural and include things that aren't directly talking about how they feel about the city. (e.g. "hiring for our new factory". That might be an indication that more residents are needed to match the industry.)
