 - humans are best at length
 - the combined area of many objects is thought of as a combination of lengths. Implications:
   - Many small areas are seen as "more" than a few larger areas. Especially if the smaller areas are spread out. (Magnitude Processing in non-symbolic stimuli Leibovich argues that many small items seem more dense)
   - a rotated square is seen as larger, since its vertical / horizontal length is longer
