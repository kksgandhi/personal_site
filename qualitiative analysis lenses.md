 - flip flop: take a concept and turn it around. What if <the opposite of what the participant said> was true?
 - Can you relate it to your own perspectives for ease of understanding?
 - Are there any absolutes? Only a sith deals in those.
 - Are there any clues in the style of language that the respondent is using?
 - Search for words indicating:
   - emotion
   - time
 - Any metaphors / similes?
 - Any cases that don't fit the pattern?
