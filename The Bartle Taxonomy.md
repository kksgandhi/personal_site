From [[Game Design Frameworks-Oshea]]:

Places players on two axes (later advancements in understandings of digital worlds led to three axes)

Acting <-> Interacting:

Acting is acting upon, imposing your will over it or "winning".

Interacting is playing with, engaging with in a cooperative sense.

World <-> Players

Whether the player is interested in the world, or the other players within it.

Explicit <-> Implicit

Whether the player proactively takes action regarding what they want to do, or waits for the game world to throw them a challenge before they respond.

----------

Where someone is on these three axes leads them into 8 quadrants, generally speaking. So someone who is "Acting, World, Implicit" is what Bartle calls a "Hacker". They use a natural understanding of the game world in order to react to challenges as they arise.
