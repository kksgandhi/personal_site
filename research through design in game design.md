[[research through design]]

From Matthew Whitby: here is the paper "Games design research through game design practice" by Coulton and Hook. Has a lot of good arguements for why it is suitable for game design specificly.

Which feeds into addressing Greenwood et al.s "UNDERSTANDING THE GAP BETWEEN ACADEMICS AND GAME DEVELOPERS: AN ANALYSIS OF GAMASUTRA "

Translational resources can be blogs and post mortems, as found on Gamasutra
