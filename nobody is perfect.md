I used to have a bunch of personal [[idols]], people I thought were so incredibly intelligent that they were infallible. But when I actually got to know them, I found that the very thing I lauded them for were sources of problems in their own life.

There is no personality type, no kind of person that is best. I've had a lot of people tell me I'm awesome because I can get along with anyone and am so extroverted, but even that has caused so many issues in my life.

Rather than thinking a perfect personality type exists, we all provide [[wisdom]] with our own perspectives and support each other.
