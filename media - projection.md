We [[projection|project]] our experiences onto media. If you watch a movie that deals with grief, you'll reflect on your own grief.

Media can encourage reflection by discussing abstract but universal ideas like grief, relationships, belonging, etc. and allowing their audience to project their own experiences onto the media.

In games, this projection can occur in spaces of [[stasis]] and [[stillness]]
