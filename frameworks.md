Psychological research shows that experts in fields "chunk information". A child might see $2+2=4$ and look at the 2, the +, etc. as different units. An adult
would see $2+2$ as an entire chunk that just easily maps to 4. A large
part of learning is just being able to form these chunks, having a few
simple chunks in our head allows us to form more complex chunks, and so
on. Hell, each sentence here is its own chunk in your head, this allows
you to read quickly without expending a ton of mental energy. (on reread, this kind of reminds me of [gestalt](gestalt.md) theory of perception)
I've often wondered what the point of learning formalized philosophy is.
You can have entirely valid thoughts that approximate Utilitarianism
without ever actually using the word. Philosophy is one of the few
things that can actually be done alone, with an armchair. (Obviously you
won't get far, but I mean, you can). Thing is, words like Utilitarianism
*are the chunks* that I was referring to earlier. You can think about
morality all you want, but until you have some conception of
Utilitarianism as a monolithic entity (by that name or any other),
you'll be hard pressed to form more complex thoughts or play with the
idea easily. I mean, there's nothing logically stopping you, but it
certainly makes it easier.  
This is the benefit of formalized disciplines: The complex jargon isn't
actually necessary, but it makes communication and thought itself so
much simpler.
