Steps of perspective transformation according to Mezirow:

 - Disorienting Dilemma
 - Self Examination
 - [[critical thinking|critical assessment of assumptions]]
 - Recognition that discontentment and the process of transformation is shared
 - Exploration of new roles, relationships, and actions
 - Planning a course of action
 - Acquiring skills
 - Trying new roles
 - Building [[competence]] and self-confidence in new roles and relationships
 - Reintegration into one's life

These steps don't necessarily happen in order
