[[grounded theory]]

 - It's a bit misleading because it's more a method than a theory.
   * Maybe use ground theorizing for the process, grounded theory for the product?

Key points
----------

 - It's a process for developing a new theory
 - Led by, and constantly refers back to the data. A systematic way to analyze qualitative data.
 - Analysis is not seperate from data collection, the analysis is conducted as data is collected.

Process Overview
----------------

 - Identify your "substantive area" and who to research.
 - Collect data
   * Make observations
   * Access pre-existing records 
   * Converse with participants
 - Conduct open coding
 - Write memos throughout
 - Identify the "core category" and then selectively code for that core
 - Find the theoretical codes that best organize the substantive codes
 - Review other literature and integrate your theory with it.

Strengths and Criticisms
------------------------

 - The lack of an initial literature review lends it better for newer fields of research without established literature.
 - Talks about some other stuff, but I found that too edge case-d to be useful.
