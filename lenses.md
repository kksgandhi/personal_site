Everything you know changes the way you take in new information. Someone who grew up in different circumstances than I probably views the world in an absurdly different way, which is why [[diversity]] is so important to me.

Something I've noticed out of other academics is that if you study a field for long enough, you start to see things in the context of that field. I personally am a games researcher, and a lot of times when I'm looking at things I translate them into gaming terms. [[MDA]] is a gaming specific framework, but I extend it a lot to other contexts.

I'll be real, this note made a lot more sense in my head, but whatever, I'm going to keep it up here haha.
