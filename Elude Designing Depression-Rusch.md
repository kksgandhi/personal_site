Elude is a game to foster *empathy* about [depression](depression.md), but runs into a fundamental problem that play is about *control*, and depression is about loss (of control). Decided to give the player some, only to wrench it away at opportune moments.

Birds flitted about in this forest as they pointed the way to happiness.
