I started buying expensive soap from a "luxury" store and cookies from an actual bakery. Under a blind taste test, the difference probably isn't that great (and it costs double, though [[absolute prices|does that really matter?]]). That said, the simple luxury makes me feel great, and is probably a more cost effective way of feeling good than other things.

I'm now realizing this is just a cruder way of describing [[the lipstick effect]]
