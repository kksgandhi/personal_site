To avoid [[backfire]] effects, design systems with: 

Intermixing:

Balance on message and off message content

Obfuscating:

Use framing devices to divert focus away from the game's message

Distancing:

Use fiction to increase the gap between player identity and persuasive content.

One concern I have about embedded design is that in shorter games it's difficult since you have to be more overt about your message. No time for subtlety.

Also this kinda reminds me of my thoughts on [[target the lenses]]
