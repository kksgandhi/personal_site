[[leadership]]

 - There are people who don't feel comfortable asking the group for things. "I want to do this instead" is something they may feel and imply, but never say out loud. One thing that will often happen is that these things won't be said to the whole group, but rather someone who is "the leader". Dealing with varying people who have differing views about where to go is a losing game, since you can't make everyone happy.
 - People are hesitant to say things when a plan is being laid out, but when it goes wrong, people are quick to lay blame. I believe that if a plan is clearly laid out and space is given for feedback, then everyone should be equally culpable for things that go wrong.

Note that my experience with leadership is usually in psuedo-leadership positions such as group projects where one person takes charge, instead of actual positions of authority, where the things I've written wouldn't apply in the same way.
