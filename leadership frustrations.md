There are people who don't feel comfortable asking the group for things. "I want to go here instead" is something they may feel and imply, but never say out loud. One thing that will often happen is that these things won't be said to the whole group, but rather someone who is "the leader".

Dealing with varying people who have differing views about where to go is frustrating, since you can't make everyone happy

Someone might come up with a plan (or maybe you will). You communicate that plan to everyone, and then it goes south. People blame you for it. It's even worse than "I told you so" since at least those people did tell you. It's frustrating when people don't even tell you potential issues with a plan. I feel like if you have heard and agreed to a plan, you are equally culpable if it goes wrong.
