"Recommendability" is how comfortable I feel recommending the game to others. Low recommendability doesn't mean a game is bad, it just means that it's for a niche audience or you have to have a certain mindset going in.

 - The Beginner's Guide (2 hours)
    Short, but with a powerful message. I think everyone should try this game (mostly so I can discuss it with you) Trigger Warning: Depression
   - Recommendability: 10/10
 - Papers Please (6-8 hours)
   - Working as border security in a parody of eastern block communism, you have to bend your ethics in order for your family to survive. An incredibly well made game to show how even well meaning people's ethics die after a thousand cuts.
   - Recommendability: 9/10
 - The Stanley Parable (3-4 hours)
   - Great game about free will and the life we are all stuck in. Another game that's short enough that I feel like everyone should try it.
   - Recommendability: 9/10
 - Spec Ops: The Line (8-10 hours)
   - An intense commentary on the military and the brutal wars we start. Trigger warning: war crimes
   - Recommendability: 6/10 (For gore and an incredibly intensive story)
 - [[The Talos Principle]] (20-30 hours)
   - This game taught me more philosophy than any textbook ever could. Beautiful story, beautiful message, and tons of neat puzzles. [[The Talos Principle|Click here for some video essays that summarize the game without you having to play the whole long thing]]
   - Recommendability: 6/10 (It's very long, and while I think the length helps the game's message soak in, it is still a problem)
 - The Witness (30+ hours)
   - A Zen garden of puzzles with a beautiful message, though it doesn't really tell you the message until late into the game. Beautifully designed
   - Recommendability: 5/10 (For reasons why, check out my note on [[The Witness]])
 - Antichamber (20-30 hours)
   - Mind bending puzzle game, teaches you to not always focus on the obvious solution. Not ultra philosophical, but still tons of fun with a neat message.
   - Recommendability: 8/10
 - Dujanah (4-5 hours)
   - A painful and complex story about dealing with grief. This game is actively painful to play, just like grief is painful.
   - Recommendability: 1/10
