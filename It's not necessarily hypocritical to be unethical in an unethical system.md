Let's say a town has 5 stores that employ the workers of that town, and the workers are desperate enough that they will take basically any pay rate given to them.

One of the stores advocates for a higher minimum wage so that workers can be paid fairly, but knows that if they pay their workers a higher wage while the other stores pay a lower wage, they will be outcompeted and go out of business. In this toy scenario, I'd argue that it's not [[hypocrisy|hypocritical]] to advocate for a higher minimum wage while also not participating themselves.
