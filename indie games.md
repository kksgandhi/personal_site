"My rating" is how much I enjoyed a game.

"Recommendability" is how comfortable I feel recommending the game to others. Low recommendability doesn't mean a game is bad, it just means that it's for a niche audience or you have to have a certain mindset going in.

**The short paragraphs I've written here do not do the games justice. If a game interests you, message me because I always love to talk about them**

### A Short Hike (2-3 hours)

This game makes me happy on a core level. It's completely pure and innocent joy, and touches me in a way very few things have. I tell everyone I can to buy this game and save it for a rainy or sad day.

My rating:        9/10

Recommendability: 10/10

### Mutazione (5-6 hours)

Very cute, very relaxing, and has a very interesting story / themes on "growth". Growth of your character, growth of the community, and growth of relationships. [[Mutazione|Here's an essay I wrote for a game design course about Mutazione]]

My rating:        9/10

Recommendability: 9/10

### Undertale (6-8 hours)

This game has a cult following for a reason! Incredibly memorable characters and a very unique approach to character relationships that I unfortunately can't speak about because of spoilers...

My rating: 8/10

Recommendability: 8/10

### [[Gris]] (3-4 hours)

Literally the most beautiful game I've ever played, every frame of that game is wallpaper worthy. I played Gris when I was at a bad point in my life, and afterwards I described it as a game that squished my soul back together again. Honestly I'm not sure how memorable the game is, nor do I know how recommendable it is (since it's rather slow at times), but it absolutely deserves to be on this list.

My rating: 8/10

Recommendability: 8/10

### To the Moon (2-3 hours)

A beautiful and sad story, though I will admit the gameplay is kinda clunky. One of the few games that I gave up on playing and instead watched a video of, though the story is still amazing.

My rating: 9/10

Recommendability: 7/10

### Celeste (15-20 hours)

Platformers have been done to death, and in all honesty I don't really like the genre... Celeste is the exception. The game is about climbing a mountain, but the main character is mostly climbing to escape her anxieties. Celeste does a wonderful job intertwining the narrative arc of overcoming anxiety with the mechanical arc of overcoming the mountain's challenges. The game is meant to be challenging, and though there are settings to lower its difficulty, this game isn't for everyone.

My rating: 7/10

Recommendability: 6/10

### A Hat in Time (9 hours)

This was a cute modern interpretation of the fun and style of Super Mario Galaxy

My rating: 7/10

Recommendability: 7/10 (it's still a slightly difficult platformer, though still one of the more accessible ones)

### Outer Wilds (24+ hours)

By fucking god do I love Outer Wilds. When I'm sad, I listen to Outer Wilds music and every time it hits me like a truck. The story is incredible, and the way that it lets you put the story together instead of just letting you walk through the story linearly makes you incredibly emotionally invested in the things I was piecing together. It is a very niche game: It is an exploration focused game that doesn't hold your hand, with a variety of puzzles and complex challenges. Absolutely worth it if you think that's the kind of game for you.

My rating:        10/10

Recommendability: 4/10
