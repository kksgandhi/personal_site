[[the singularity|The singularity is near. The singularity is nearer.]] I'm scared. But even if I'm wrong about the singularity...

I've grown up in an America that's been in perpetual war with the middle east. Every day, more bad actors gain nuclear capabilities, advances in biotech make 3D-printed bioweapons more likely, and global warming grows a larger threat.

Every one of the issues mentioned above and more mean that the world will truly be unrecognizable soon. I feel like we're on the precipice of incredible good in the future or incredible devastation, and [[apocalypse|everything we do right now is absolutely meaningless.]]

I joke with my friends that my retirement plan is that civilization will collapse by the time I'm 65 and currency will be worthless. I'm not sure how much of a joke it really is.
