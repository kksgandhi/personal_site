[[Kurzweil]]'s "The Singularity is Near" talks about how technological growth is exponential. When I was born, the internet was useful, but slow, unnavigable, and limited in scope. Nowadays, the internet is all encompassing, to the point where we even talk about how social media sites are undermining democracy itself.

It is entirely feasible, even probable that in the next 20 year period, technology will change the world to the point where it looks completely different. 20 years. *20 years.* Another 20 years after that and the world will definitely be unrecognizable.

That's... That's fucking absurd. Like we all go about our lives, because nothing changes day to day, but how can anyone even function in the face of that instability? I sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, believe that in my lifetime, AI will usher us into a [[post scarcity economy]] or [[AI control problem|destroy us all]].

The reason this file is titled "The precipice" and not "the singularity" is because I think the problem goes beyond AI. 

I've grown up in an America that's been in perpetual war with the middle east. Every day, more bad actors gain nuclear capabilities, advances in biotech make 3D-printed bioweapons more likely, and global warming grows a larger threat.

Every one of the issues mentioned above and more mean that the world will truly be unrecognizable soon. I feel like we're on the precipice of incredible good in the future or incredible devastation, and everything we do right now is absolutely meaningless.

I joke with my friends that my retirement plan is that civilization will collapse by the time I'm 65 and currency will be worthless. I'm not sure how much of a joke it really is.
