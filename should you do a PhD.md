Most people shouldn't do a PhD. It's easy for them to go wrong, it's easy to do a lot with little to show for it, and it's easy to get into them for the wrong reasons.

Some questions to ask yourself:

 - Am I just doing this because I'm scared of the real world? Just because I don't know what to do next? Those are bad reasons to do a PhD.
 - Am I passionate enough about the subject to self-motivate for years?
 - Have I found an advisor whose style works for me? 
   - **Talk to a professor's current students**. You don't want to be stuck for years with someone who is secretly abusive or whose communication style doesn't work for you.
