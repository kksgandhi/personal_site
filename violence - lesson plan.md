This video by philosophy tube on protest and violence has a lot of ideas: (https://youtu.be/dh4G1Gjv7bA?si=qXQqPKSagrtFDorm)

What is self defense? How immediate does the harm have to be? What are some obvious examples where self defense is or isn't justified? What are examples that toe the line, where the justification is less clear?

Is a CEO who intentionally pollutes committing violence on a community?

SUV makers have lobbied congress to avoid regulations. Is that violence? There are some people who deflate the tires of SUVs and large trucks because those large vehicles are deadlier to pedestrians. Is this justified?

Discuss the paradox of tolerance.

In Star Wars the death star is destroyed by the rebellion with thousands of maintenance workers, janitors, cooks, etc. on board. Is that a justified act? The U.S. commits war crimes, so is everyone associated with the military culpable? (Similarly, I'll mention the concept of war crimes, but I won't go into specific cases or detail)

The police are allowed to use violence for their job. Is this justified, and if so, why? Introduce the concept of the state's monopoly on violence. (While I'll mention the idea of police brutality, I won't go deep into specific cases or be overly detailed, to avoid causing distress.)

Is a politician taking away someone's healthcare a violent act? What if they start a war?

Is Batman ok?

premeditated self defense

(Right now I think this plan skews too hard towards "acts that you wouldn't think are violent, but debatably are". As I continue to build this plan, I'll look for examples of people who thought their actions were justified, but weren't, e.g. Germans who believed Jews were undermining German society)
