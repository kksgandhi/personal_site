Games struggle with the following goals and contexts:

 - Communicating large amounts of content. For [[declarative learning]], just use a book, video, or lecture.
 - Communicating *specific* content, since everyone's experience with a game is different.
 - Games are inaccessible. You can put a video on in the background or read a book on the bus. Many video games are harder to play.
 - Games take many resources to build, which could be better spent elsewhere.
 - A bad game adds extra time wasting elements.
