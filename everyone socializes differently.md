Some people like to participate in large chats, some will only respond if you text them individually, some won't respond for days. It's frustrating to me, because some people act in certain ways when they are mad at me, while others act in that exact same way, but that's just the way they are.

I like to [[communication|communicate]] about my style of socializing to avoid problems like the one above.
