From the Executive Summary:

These students need flexibility, such as what can be given by game based learning.

specific applications of GBL:

 - auto assessing what students have learned
 - employment skills in real world applications
 - providing a safe environment for trial and error
 - developing and assessing critical thinking skills
 - study strategy and student success skills (I'm not sure what this means)

GBL should be flexible, but a custom solution each time is costly.

GBL should be authorable and inexpensive, rather than custom built and high cost.

It should fit into existing curriculum and student's lives

should work on all devices.
