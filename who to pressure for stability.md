Protesters and strikers are annoying and painful to deal with, but I'm concerned that the solution is usually to crack down on the protesters, instead of making the positive change they are arguing for.

When writers were striking, so many people got annoyed, but felt like the solution was forcing the writers back to work, instead of paying them more.
