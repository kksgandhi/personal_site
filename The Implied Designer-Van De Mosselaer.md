Authors: [[Van De Mosselaer]] [[Gualeni]]

Works of fiction have authors, and everyone knows that.

We don't always think about author intentions while interacting with media, nor is it always necessary.

Players conceptualize a designer based on their dynamic interpretation of the game. To this inferred figure, the player ascribes all intentions they think lie at the basis of the creation of the game.

Interaction between the player and the [[implied designer]] modifies player behavior. In many contexts, the implied designer can be more important than the actual designer.

When a game immerses us, we conceive of it as 'perfect', without bugs. The present version, with bugs and flaws is seen as an unwanted stand in for the real thing.

games can use this intentionally with red herrings, [[4th wall breaking]].

A player will see enemies and know that they are supposed to go that direction. Will see overleveled enemies and know that they aren't. This is all because players know that a designer designed the game.
