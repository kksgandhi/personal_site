I fear that much of the philosophy around death is [[wishful philosophy]], [worshiping thirst, when one lives in a desert](http://smbc-comics.com/comic/2013-01-29) Whether or not those philosophies are valid, waxing poetic about how death gives life meaning is done better by others, so let me talk about some other aspects of death that interest me:

 - [[death of a self]]
 - [[the tail end]]
 - [[everyone has value]]
 - [[the death of who we are]]
