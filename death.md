I fear that much of the philosophy around death is [[wishful philosophy]]. I feel that, whether those philosophies are valid or not, waxing poetic about how death gives life meaning is done better by others, so let me talk about some other aspects of death that interest me:

 - [[death of a self]]
 - [[the tail end]]
 - [[everyone has value]]
