Traditional user research methods include:

[[player observation|observation]], such as larger scale analysis of the various paths users took, what objects they interacted with, etc. Observation could also occur on a smaller scale, such as identifying facial cues and body language, however this is intensive to conduct and usually requires video footage.

[[think aloud]], which is useful in getting player thoughts "in the moment", though there is some evidence indicating that it can be disruptive to the play session

heuristics evaluation, a way to understand the accessibility of the game without any code being written

Interviews and Questionnaires are convenient, but only reflect a finished experience and is prone to bias such as [[post rationalization]]

something called RITE which combines observation and think aloud

Some biometrics tools that have been used: 

 - Facial Electromyography as a measure of positive and negative emotional valence.
 - Cardiac Interbeat Intervals
 - Electroenephalography
 - Heart Rate
 - Galvanic Skin Response
   - Not very intrusive, just some pads that go on the fingertips, though these can get in the way of certain game controllers.
 - Eye Tracking

There is a correlation between subjective experiences and these biometric trackers and these trackers can be used to create emotional profiles.

This paper included a case study of Galvanic Skin Response
