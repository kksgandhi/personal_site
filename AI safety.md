AI can be "[[AI alignment|unaligned]]" (it doesn't do what its creators want) or "[[AI misuse|misused]]" (it does what its creators want, and its creators are assholes).

We can also think [[AI short term issues|short term]] (what systems do we have right now, what harm can they cause / are they causing) and we can think long term (what harm can a genius level AI cause, maybe even one that is smarter than us humans).
