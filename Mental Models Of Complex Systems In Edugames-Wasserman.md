Players had great recall of individual game elements, but in the one play session didn't recall too many complex relations.

Players conflated abstract game entities with the physical objects they were playing with. The authors argue that this conflation (lamination as they call it) is integral to learning analog games.

Mentions Sitzmann 2011 when talking about how player actions are a key part of learning, that differentiates from static media.
