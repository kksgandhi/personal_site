Taken from [[Ethics and MMOs]] which is summarizing the [[Bhagavad Gita]]

[[games can teach philosophy through simulation]], but [[game worlds are inherently limited]] simulations. [[negative escapism|Simulations are negative systems]] that distract from the real world.

What if you flipped that idea on its head and looked at the real world as a simulation ([[cartesian demons|it's not unreasonable]]) created to improve your soul, and the struggles of the real world existed just as teaching.

If this is the case, then [[suicide]] prevents you from fully learning the lessons of your life, and instead the suffering is for nothing.
