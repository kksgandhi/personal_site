Networking is good because it gives you:

 - friends you can talk about work with
 - experienced people who can give you advice or maybe even jobs.
 - potential collaborators

Going to conferences is a great idea, but they're pretty overwhelming. [[conference prep|Be prepared]].

Building a good network takes time: repeatedly going to conferences, staying in contact with people, and building an online presence. Every month, I would ask myself:

 - What have I been struggling with. Is there anyone in my network I can message about it? Add these questions to a list you bring to conferences.
 - What have I done recently (or been thinking about) that I can turn into a LinkedIn Post

I'd also update my resume each month and update my answers to [[mock interview questions]]. Answering these questions gives you perspective on how to market yourself.
