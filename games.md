Games are a low stakes way to prepare us for the challenges of life. I've learned more about [[leadership]] though playing [[DnD]] than I have through any leadership course I've ever taken. [[Minecraft]] redstone was what initially got me thinking about circuits, turing completeness, and how computers operate and probably put me on a path to become a computer scientist. Even "silly" games like jackbox have taught me tons about my friends and deepened my bonds with them.

Games are often written off because the benefits are harder to see, and often teach "soft skills". I have no doubt in my mind that a child who played [[Buffalo]] with their friends for an hour gained invaluable skills, but those skills are harder to quantify than "my child watched a lecture on math for an hour and now knows what a parabola is".

Similarly, I'm frustrated that games (especially video games) are often lumped together. Many people think all video games are violent irredeemable shooting games.
