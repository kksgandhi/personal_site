#coherentism

I always used to count myself lucky that, despite being a Muslim growing
up in post 9-11 Texas, I wasn't really the target of much harassment.
Sure, my parents told me stories about how they hired cops at my 4th (or
something) birthday party, but as far as I can actually remember, overt
and blatant racism has happened to me once or twice. (I did grow up
presenting mostly Indian, not Muslim, and lived in a wealthy and diverse
community. I'm sure that contributed *heavily*)\
It was really only till the end of senior year of college when I
realized how racism actually affected me personally. It's always been a
running joke that I'm an Indian guy in Computer Science. Checks all the
boxes. Amongst my friends I would happily use my Indian accent to say "Have you tried turning it off and back on again?".
Typically these sorts of jokes are what would be described as , which
many people legitimately have an issue with. But microaggressions
weren't actually what got me. I enjoyed the jokes and never found them
truly grating. My friends were always respectful and took me for who I
was, never crossing boundaries with microaggressive jokes.\
Without realizing it however, this stereotype changed the way I
interacted with new people, and even affected many of my life decisions.
Whenever I presented myself to someone new, I'd always mention my
interest in Philosophy or Games first. I wasn't "an Indian dude in CS", I was "someone interested in computer science and philosophy." If you are
white, you are the default and people try to understand you for who you
are. I displayed my interest in philosophy as a shield from people
assuming I was a socially awkward robot. I don't think you'd have to do
the same if you didn't fall into a stereotype.\
But that went beyond how I presented myself. I chose classes partially
because I wondered how they would look when I presented myself. I wanted
to take philosophy courses, of course, but I also wanted to be that
cultured dude who's taken Ethics 306.\
Thing is, all of this was so absurdly subtle that I never really
realized it. Yes I mentioned how I took classes to appear more cultured,
but the vast majority was that I simply liked Philosophy. The changes in
my behavior were slight, unimportant, but they compounded without me
realizing it. And yes, if I were a white CS student I'm sure I would
have had similar issues presenting myself as an interesting CS student,
but I just don't think it's the same as having the three adjectives of
Indian, Male, and CS.\
