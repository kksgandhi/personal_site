general effect 

A Game

* Sticker Book: choose a cairn sticker among several, place it somewhere on a page. Players asynchronously build up a collage of different stickers in different arrangements.

* Message Board: Players construct a message from pre-written phrases a la dark souls. A history of messages is shown.

* Jackbox/Telltale Choice: players are asked a question like "which of these images was the clearest/hardest" or "which of these images is your favorite", after picking they see statistics on what options other players picked.

* Leaderboard: players are shown how much they are contributing compared to other players (several stats we can choose from, present one randomly)

* Leave a Rock: players choose a color of rock to leave, then get to play in a physics sandbox with all of the rocks that are present.

* creating a little jingle for other users to encounter (I was thinking about Spore's anthem composer as an idea)

* coloring a small piece of an image (like a coloring book) that others have also colored in

* we don't want people to give each other tips or talk to each other, right? Cairns would be less customized, more general activities?

* everyone literally builds a cairn until someone's stone tips it over. The person who tips it over gets to start a new one
