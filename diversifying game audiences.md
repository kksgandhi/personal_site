I want gaming to be as accessible as possible. This leads to two problems:

 - [[gaming and minority identities|Making gaming appealing to identities that are typically underrepresented in gaming.]]#
 - [[games for nongamers|Making gaming appealing to those who generally aren't familiar with games]]#.

There's overlap between the two groups, but it's not necessarily full overlap.

[[video game accessibility|Games have accessibility issues]]
