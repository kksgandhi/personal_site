[[documenting research through design]]

 - Background has some interesting discussion of three paradigms of HCI and how HCI research tries to focus too much on individual variables rather than holistic gameplay.
 - Talks briefly about "recoverability" as a counterpoint to the usual notion of "rigour", but doesn't really define recoverability... has some references though.

--------------------

 - You typically teach "mechanics lead to aesthetics", but that implies the mechanics were always there and ignores iteration.
 - Propose using git and commits at minimum based on:
   - completed features
   - design questions
   - competing versions and prototypes (via branches)
 - Qualitative research is subjective, but making the process of design available allows other researchers to look and critique a game's design trajectory.

----------------------------------------

So in summary, use git as a diary, and have an actual diary for larger and more complex ideas.
