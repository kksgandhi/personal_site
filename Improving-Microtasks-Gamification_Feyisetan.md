You gamify crowdwork? it gets better :D

didn't create a novel experience, just wanted fun with games

what defines games?

* a goal
* rules
* feedback system
* voluntary participation

game elements

* points
* levels
* leaderboards
* badges

Built a game called wordsmith also introduced a social aspect

[higher pay in crowdsourcing](higher%20pay%20in%20crowdsourcing.md) may not actually lead to better outcomes

talks about the [overjustification](overjustification.md) effect, which is like the crowding out effect, but for gamification

talks about some other frameworks for incentive engineering including *MICE*, *RASCLS*, and *SAPS*

other research has been done about *game theory* in incentive design. They use a probabilistic approach to predict player behavior.

*feedback* was given to players

* Leaderboard
* Levels
* Badges
* Feedback Alerts (on how to achieve bonus points)
* Bonus points
* Treasure points (for streaks)
* Activities showing what others were doing in real time

Voluntary participation via presenting the task as something the player wanted to do

Leaving players would be given a powerup to keep them in the game

Did some fancy statistics to figure out how much each powerup actually kept people in the game
