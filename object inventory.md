Categorizing the "stuff" in a game, maybe even via a spreadsheet with the following columns:

 - Whether objects are single or multi use
 - The interaction options for objects: do they have one use (and what is it)?
 - Do objects have multiple uses (and what are they)?
 - Do those uses change over time?
 - The object's cost
 - A general description of the object.

The idea being to answer larger questions about the purpose and importance of the stuff in the game.
