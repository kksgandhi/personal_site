Some person or team makes a groundbreaking, well designed product. They want to share their design process and insights with the world, but there are 2 hurdles: First, they may not have documented all of their design choices, since their goal was to just get the product created. Second, they can't really focus on the dissemination of insights because their job is to make products, not talk about them.

**Research through design is a research methodology that attempts to make a "perfect" product (as impossible as that is), all while carefully documenting the design process, with the final intention of creating insights others can learn from.**

According to [[Research Through Design In Hci-Zimmerman]], RTD is different than design practice in two ways:

 - Built without a focus on commercial success (though real world considerations like cost should absolutely be thought of)
 - RTD artifacts should do something novel (practitioners may do a lot of design that doesn't actually push the boundaries)

RTD is a good approach for an academic looking for teaching positions, since it allows you to say "oh yeah I'm a designer, and I can teach design."
