Also known as Design Based Research?

A research methodology where you document and discuss the design of an artifact.

Beneficial since, when applying for academic jobs you can say "oh yeah I'm a designer and I can teach that"

Courtney Blamey's RTD approach:

 - Game analysis and think aloud play (2 or 3 games)
 - Player & Dev interviews (5 players per game, not too many)
 - Iterative prototyping
 - Iterative player interviewing and close play with others
 
Don't wait to finish a step before starting the next one

How generalizable is your artifact's design? Test via making variations

Frustrations with designing games in a research context:

 - Every design decision needs to be justified. How do you even cite many of these design decisions?
 - Reusability of design elements across different groups is a problem
 - Sole developer is a rough spot to be in
 - interdisciplinary work is difficult
 - Using existing games would be nice, but is tough
 - To measure your design goals, you want players playing in a certain way, but that gets in the way of player agency.

According to [[Research Through Design In Hci-Zimmerman]], RTD is different than design practice in two ways:

 - Built without a focus on commercial success (though real world considerations like cost should absolutely be thought of)
 - RTD artifacts should do something novel (practitioners may do a lot of design that doesn't actually push the boundaries)

How can you evaluate an RTD project? Also from [[Research Through Design In Hci-Zimmerman]]:

 - is the process they used documented and rigorous?
 - did they take the existing literature and extend it to something new?
 - relevance. What is the current state, your motivation, and how does this artifact push the world to a preferred state? (this section also talks about how designers shouldn't worry about reproduceability)
 - extensibility; can the work be used and built upon?
