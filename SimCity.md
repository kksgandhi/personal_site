[Notes from this playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFZfx_mCZoo&list=PLYqfXQ-ztmZKiV9Ro0FNMe-GYD_U3-tiG)

 - social aspects, sharing cities with others
 - different regions
 - huge amount of mechanics (e.g. resources, pollution, more granular controls for building the city), which is probably better for education, but means that it takes a long time to learn.
 - explicit zoning. You can set zones and people will slowly build up.
 - bubbles popping up with people's needs
 - you can click on people and see how they're feeling.
 - money economy, you can buy infrastructure.
 - lots more infrastructure requirements, you have to deal with sewers, power, water.
 - seemingly full traffic simulation, but probably not internally
 - "gambling houses bring a lot of crime... we have a lot of uneducated, low income, low density housing here, which is a hotbed for crime."
 - seemingly no issues with the stroad
 - hypothesis about fun:
   - comes from watching your city grow
   - comes from getting to manage the city and balance variables.
   - comes from slow play, getting to enjoy just watching
 - doesn't seem to discuss liveability, walkability, fun etc.

Notes from episode 10:

 - Simcity gives a lot of information, focuses very much on the technical aspects.
 - points out how land value increases or decreases based on surrounding parks, buildings, etc.
 - seems you can click on someone to hear their thoughts, but it doesn't give it to you automatically.
 - organic moment where a firetruck was stuck in traffic, so a house burned down.

[Looked at this video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O42kxeilMaQ) [and this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46nD0ilK4Qo), but neither seemed like they were really talking about the design.

[This is GDC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H97yxaa08SA)

 - Talked about how it was an old IP, not an issue for me.
 - Talked about how it was a mobile game, not an issue for me.
 - Talked about how it was free to play, not an issue for me.
 - Talked about the open-ended simulation.
   - Illusion and perception are more important than what's happening under the hood. Communicating to the player that things are happening is super important.

Unfortunately wasn't too helpful...
