I've seen people saying they aren't going to vote for Biden in 2024 because they don't want to support the actions he's taken in the Isreal-Palestine conflict.

Let's be real with ourselves though â€” *paying taxes* is "supporting" the government, and if you don't want to support them, you should become a [tax resistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_resistance_in_the_United_States). If you pay taxes and don't vote, what you're saying is "Yeah I support the government, and I don't care how it is run."
