Counting is still important in qualitative research, however there are some pitfalls to avoid

even small sample sizes can lead to absurd amounts of data 

Verbal counting: Saying "A few, most, etc.". Create a lookup table that defines your terms?

Overcounting: Adding too many numbers to add a veneer of quantitativeness. Include it in the aesthetics of your writing. Instead of saying "3 women said this" say something like "The three women who did this also XYZ"

don't use percentages, under 25 samples just say numbers

don't just count without context. Don't say x% were X, without offering any other information about them.
